## 2.5 Planning of the Project

The planning of Modula POS was organized as a phased development plan over a total duration of twelve weeks. While the project was initially scoped as a capstone prototype, the team’s implementation trajectory moved toward a high-fidelity prototype due to the level of functional integration achieved across modules. As a result, project planning emphasized both structured phase progression and iterative refinement as new technical and business requirements were discovered during implementation.

### 2.5.1 Planning Structure and Timeline

The project was planned using a phase-based structure consisting of the following stages:

- **Initiation**
    
    Proposal preparation, initial requirement gathering, and background study to build a shared understanding of Point of Sale systems and their operational needs.
    
- **System Design**
    
    Definition of the overall architecture, early module specifications (formal descriptions of module responsibilities, boundaries, and interactions), and initial separation between core system responsibilities and feature modules.
    
- **UI/UX Design**
    
    Production of detailed wireframes covering key functional areas, including login, portals, policy configuration, inventory, menu management, sales, cash sessions, order handling, reporting, and receipt views.
    
- **Development**
    
    Frontend and backend implementation based on the UI/UX designs and evolving module specifications.
    

In practice, these phases were not executed strictly sequentially. Instead, they overlapped intentionally to support parallel development. For example, once UI/UX designs for early workflows were completed (such as login), backend development could begin on related modules (such as authentication and tenant context), while frontend developers implemented the corresponding UI and view-model layers using hard-coded data or mock repositories. Once backend APIs became available, frontend integration replaced mocks with real data sources using backend-provided API contracts.

This overlapping development model improved productivity under limited team resources and reduced idle time caused by sequential dependencies.

### 2.5.2 Team Organization and Responsibilities

The project was implemented by a six-member team. For reporting clarity, members are referenced using aliases: Z, K, T, V, R, and H. Responsibilities were distributed as follows:

- **Lead Development and Documentation:** Z
- **Frontend Development:** Z and V
- **Backend Development:** R and H
- **UI/UX Design:** K and T
- **Acceptance Testing:** Z

This structure supported specialization while allowing the lead developer to coordinate integration efforts and maintain consistency across documentation and implementation.

### 2.5.3 Work Coordination and Communication

Work coordination followed a task-driven approach rather than daily meetings. Because all team members were full-time students, the project did not adopt daily stand-ups. Instead, coordination occurred through:

- Kickoff meetings at the start of assigned tasks to clarify requirements and expected outcomes.
- Evaluation meetings upon task completion to review implementation results and validate alignment with module specifications.

Meetings were typically conducted one-to-one between the lead developer (Z) and the team member responsible for the task, enabling focused technical discussion and faster decision-making.

Progress tracking was managed using a lightweight Scrum-style board during development, with the intention to transition toward a more formal tool such as Jira for improved visibility and reporting.

### 2.5.4 Planning Adaptation and Specification Refinement

A defining characteristic of the project planning process was the continuous refinement of module specifications as implementation progressed. Early planning identified functional areas such as sales, inventory, reporting, multi-branch support, and staff attendance; however, several components were initially underspecified due to limited team experience in modular system design.

During execution, the team improved planning quality by systematically refining module specifications to:

- explicitly define module boundaries and responsibilities,
- clarify dependencies and cross-module impacts,
- remove ambiguous or impractical business logic, and
- align documentation more closely with what could be implemented within Capstone I constraints.

This refinement led to important discoveries and adjustments. For example, multi-branch support was reinterpreted not as a standalone module but as part of the tenant-and-branch context. Additionally, the need for a dedicated cash session module emerged after identifying integrity risks in sales workflows.

The UI/UX development process also influenced specification refinement. While wireframes provided strong structural guidance, interaction details were often faster to validate through frontend prototypes than through exhaustive design-tool simulation. As a result, manual testing and real usage flows became an important feedback mechanism that informed iterative improvement of both the module specifications and system behavior.

Overall, the project planning approach can be characterized as **goal-driven and iterative**: a structured phase plan provided direction, while continuous refinement ensured that the system remained feasible, consistent, and aligned with real operational constraints discovered through development.
