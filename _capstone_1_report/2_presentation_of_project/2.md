## 2.1 General Presentation of the Project

Modula is a modular Point-of-Sale (POS) system designed to provide small and medium-sized businesses with a flexible and accessible digital solution for managing daily operations. The project was developed as part of Capstone I with the objective of addressing practical challenges faced by emerging businesses, particularly in the Food and Beverage (F&B) sector, where operational efficiency, cost sensitivity, and adaptability are critical factors for sustainability.

In its current scope, Modula focuses on delivering a **web-based POS system optimized for mobile devices**. This design choice reflects real-world usage patterns observed in small F&B businesses, where owners and staff frequently rely on smartphones or shared devices rather than dedicated POS terminals. By targeting the web platform first, Modula allows businesses to adopt digital operations without requiring immediate investment in specialized hardware, such as cash drawers or receipt printers. This approach lowers the entry barrier for digital transformation and enables businesses to experiment with structured operations before committing to additional costs.

A central concept behind Modula is its **modular design philosophy**. Instead of providing a monolithic system with a fixed and extensive feature set, Modula is structured around independent modules that can be enabled, configured, or extended as business needs evolve. This aligns with the principle of “pay only for what you need,” allowing businesses to start with essential functionality—such as sales and inventory management—and gradually scale up by adopting additional modules when required. In Capstone I, this modularity is expressed through clearly defined core and feature modules, each responsible for a specific domain of the system.

Although Modula is initially developed with the F&B industry as its primary use case, the system is intentionally designed as a **foundational platform rather than an industry-specific endpoint**. The architectural decisions made during Capstone I—such as modular separation, policy-driven behavior, and device-agnostic access—are intended to support future adaptation to other business domains, including retail or service-oriented operations. However, it is important to emphasize that Capstone I does not aim to support multiple industries simultaneously. Instead, it establishes a solid and extensible foundation upon which future iterations of Modula can be built.

From a broader perspective, Modula represents an effort to bridge the gap between informal business practices and fully digital operations. Many small businesses operate without integrated systems, relying on manual tracking or disconnected tools that limit visibility and scalability. Modula seeks to address this gap by offering a POS system that is both technically robust and pragmatically aligned with the constraints of small business environments. By combining a low entry point, modular scalability, and a mobile-friendly web interface, Modula positions itself as a practical stepping stone for businesses transitioning toward more structured and data-driven operations.

In summary, Modula is presented in this capstone project as a modular, web-based POS system tailored to the needs of small F&B businesses. While limited in scope to ensure feasibility within academic and resource constraints, the system embodies design principles that support long-term growth, extensibility, and real-world applicability beyond the boundaries of Capstone I.

## 2.2 Problems

Small and medium-sized businesses, particularly in the Food and Beverage (F&B) sector, face a range of operational challenges when operating without an integrated digital Point-of-Sale (POS) system. These challenges are not limited to technical inefficiencies but extend to business sustainability, scalability, and competitiveness in increasingly digital markets. The absence of an appropriate POS solution often results in fragmented workflows, limited visibility into operations, and difficulties in adapting to business growth.

One of the most significant problems is the reliance on **manual or semi-digital processes** for handling sales, inventory, and staff activities. Many small businesses record transactions on paper, spreadsheets, or disconnected applications. While these methods may appear sufficient at an early stage, they are prone to human error, lack real-time insight, and make it difficult to trace historical data accurately. As transaction volume increases, these limitations become more pronounced, leading to inconsistencies in financial records and inventory counts.

Another critical issue is **inventory mismanagement**. Without a system that systematically tracks stock movements, businesses struggle to maintain accurate inventory levels. Over-ordering results in waste and increased costs, while under-ordering leads to stock shortages and lost sales opportunities. In F&B environments, where ingredients may expire and menu items depend on precise stock availability, poor inventory tracking directly affects both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Cost and accessibility also present substantial barriers to digital adoption. Many commercial POS systems are designed with larger businesses in mind and require upfront investment in dedicated hardware such as terminals, receipt printers, and cash drawers. For small or newly established businesses, this financial commitment can be prohibitive. As a result, owners delay digital adoption or rely on improvised solutions that do not scale effectively. Even when software-only solutions exist, they often bundle unnecessary features, forcing businesses to pay for functionality they do not yet need.

In addition, existing POS solutions frequently lack **flexibility and scalability**. Businesses that start small may later expand by adding staff, branches, or new operational workflows. Systems that are rigid in design make such transitions difficult, often requiring migration to entirely new platforms. This disrupts operations and increases the long-term cost of digitalization. Without a modular approach, businesses are forced into an all-or-nothing commitment rather than being able to grow incrementally.

There is also a growing **competitive pressure** for businesses to adopt digital solutions. Customers increasingly expect faster service, clearer receipts, and consistent pricing, while business owners need access to operational data to make informed decisions. Businesses that continue to operate without structured digital systems risk being outperformed by competitors who leverage data-driven insights and streamlined workflows. In this context, the lack of an accessible POS system is not merely an operational inconvenience but a strategic disadvantage.

Finally, many available solutions fail to account for **real-world usage constraints**, such as intermittent internet connectivity or shared device usage. In practical environments, especially in developing regions, network reliability cannot always be assumed. Systems that require constant connectivity or dedicated devices are poorly suited to such conditions, further limiting their usability for small businesses.

These problems collectively highlight the need for a POS system that is affordable, flexible, device-agnostic, and capable of supporting gradual business growth. Modula is proposed as a response to these challenges, aiming to provide a practical and modular solution that addresses operational inefficiencies while remaining aligned with the realities faced by small F&B businesses.

## 2.3 Target Users

Modula is designed as an organizational Point of Sale system intended to support multiple users operating within a single business or enterprise context. Rather than targeting individual consumers, Modula addresses the needs of businesses by accommodating different categories of users who interact with the system in distinct ways. These users differ not only in their responsibilities, but also in their relationship to the system as customers, operators, or employees. Clearly distinguishing these groups is essential to understanding Modula’s design rationale and intended usage.

### 2.3.1 Business Owners (Primary Customers)

The primary target users of Modula are business owners, who represent the system’s core customers. Business owners are responsible for subscribing to the platform, adopting it within their organization, and determining how it is deployed across their operations. In the context of Capstone I, Modula is initially positioned for small to medium-sized food and beverage businesses; however, its architectural design anticipates expansion into other industries in later stages.

Business owners may operate their businesses in different ways. Some owners manage a single outlet and personally handle daily operations, while others oversee multiple outlets and delegate operational responsibilities to staff. Modula is designed to support both scenarios by offering a low entry barrier for small operations and the ability to scale as the business grows. The “pay only for what you need” principle reflects this flexibility, allowing owners to start with minimal functionality and gradually adopt additional features or branches as required.

Importantly, business owners represent the organizational authority behind the system. Even when they do not interact with Modula on a daily basis, they remain responsible for defining the structure of the organization within the system, including assigning operational users and determining how the system supports business workflows.

### 2.3.2 Delegated Operators (Administrators and Managers)

A second group of target users consists of delegated operators, typically administrators and managers appointed by the business owner. These users operate within the organizational context of the business and act on behalf of the owner in managing day-to-day activities. They are not customers of Modula themselves; rather, their access to the system is granted through delegation.

Delegated operators are common in businesses where owners are not continuously present, such as multi-branch enterprises or operations with distributed management structures. These users are responsible for overseeing operational tasks, coordinating staff, and ensuring that daily activities run smoothly. Their role reflects a trust relationship with the business owner and highlights Modula’s emphasis on organizational delegation rather than individual ownership.

By explicitly supporting delegated operators, Modula aligns with real-world business practices, where system usage is shared among multiple responsible parties rather than centralized around a single individual.

### 2.3.3 Frontline Staff (Cashiers and Operational Employees)

The third group of target users comprises frontline staff, such as cashiers and other operational employees. These users interact with Modula as part of routine service delivery and transactional workflows. Their engagement with the system is typically task-oriented and focused on operational efficiency.

Frontline staff use Modula to perform activities such as processing sales, handling orders, and supporting daily service operations. They do not participate in system configuration, organizational decisions, or subscription management. Their access exists strictly within the boundaries defined by the business owner and delegated operators.

This distinction reinforces Modula’s design as an organizational system in which all users operate under a defined business structure. Frontline staff represent the most frequent users of the system, yet they remain functionally and structurally separate from ownership and management roles.

### Summary

Across all user categories, Modula is designed to function as a shared organizational platform rather than a personal application. Business owners, delegated operators, and frontline staff each interact with the system according to their position within the organization. This clear separation of user groups supports scalability, accountability, and long-term system evolution, while remaining consistent with the operational realities of small and medium-sized businesses.

## 2.4 Objectives

The development of Modula is guided by a set of clearly defined objectives that reflect both the academic goals of the Capstone I project and the broader vision of creating a practical, scalable Point of Sale system. These objectives are structured around a central main objective, supported by several specific objectives that address technical, operational, and contextual considerations.

### 2.4.1 Main Objective

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a **modular, web-based Point of Sale system** that supports essential business operations for small and medium-sized food and beverage enterprises, while remaining adaptable for future expansion into other industries.

Modula aims to demonstrate how a thoughtfully designed POS system can balance real-world usability with sound software engineering principles. Rather than delivering a feature-heavy but rigid solution, the project emphasizes modularity, scalability, and a low barrier to entry. The system is intended to function effectively as a Capstone I deliverable while also laying a solid foundation for future academic work and potential product evolution beyond the scope of the course.

### 2.4.2 Specific Objectives

To support the main objective, the project defines the following specific objectives:

1. **Provide a low entry point for digital adoption**
    
    Modula is designed to allow small businesses to adopt a POS system without requiring immediate investment in dedicated hardware or complex infrastructure. By supporting web-based operation on mobile devices and shared terminals, the system enables businesses to experiment with digital workflows before committing to additional costs.
    
2. **Support gradual scaling aligned with business growth**
    
    The system is structured to accommodate both single-outlet businesses and multi-branch organizations. Modula allows businesses to start small and scale up by adding branches, users, and features as operational needs evolve, without requiring architectural redesign.
    
3. **Apply modular system design principles**
    
    A key technical objective is to apply modular design at both the architectural and implementation levels. Core system responsibilities and feature-specific logic are clearly separated, enabling individual modules to evolve independently while maintaining overall system coherence.
    
4. **Ensure operational reliability and data integrity**
    
    As a POS system handles financial transactions and inventory data, Modula prioritizes correctness and consistency. The project aims to demonstrate reliable handling of sales, orders, inventory updates, cash sessions, and attendance records, even in the presence of connectivity constraints.
    
5. **Support real-world operational workflows**
    
    Modula is designed around realistic business workflows, such as order processing, cash handling, staff attendance, and reporting. These workflows are modeled to reflect how small businesses operate in practice, rather than idealized or purely theoretical processes.
    
6. **Enable offline-aware operation**
    
    Recognizing that network reliability cannot be assumed in all operating environments, the system incorporates offline-aware design principles. While full offline synchronization is deferred beyond Capstone I, the architecture is designed to support queued actions and controlled synchronization in future iterations.
    
7. **Demonstrate alignment between documentation, design, and implementation**
    
    From an academic perspective, an important objective is to maintain consistency between requirement analysis, modular specifications, architectural design, and actual implementation. The project intentionally emphasizes clarity of documentation and iterative refinement to reflect realistic software development practices.


## 2.5 Planning of the Project

The planning of Modula POS was organized as a phased development plan over a total duration of twelve weeks. While the project was initially scoped as a capstone prototype, the team’s implementation trajectory moved toward a high-fidelity prototype due to the level of functional integration achieved across modules. As a result, project planning emphasized both structured phase progression and iterative refinement as new technical and business requirements were discovered during implementation.

### 2.5.1 Planning Structure and Timeline

The project was planned using a phase-based structure consisting of the following stages:

- **Initiation**
    
    Proposal preparation, initial requirement gathering, and background study to build a shared understanding of Point of Sale systems and their operational needs.
    
- **System Design**
    
    Definition of the overall architecture, early module specifications (formal descriptions of module responsibilities, boundaries, and interactions), and initial separation between core system responsibilities and feature modules.
    
- **UI/UX Design**
    
    Production of detailed wireframes covering key functional areas, including login, portals, policy configuration, inventory, menu management, sales, cash sessions, order handling, reporting, and receipt views.
    
- **Development**
    
    Frontend and backend implementation based on the UI/UX designs and evolving module specifications.
    

In practice, these phases were not executed strictly sequentially. Instead, they overlapped intentionally to support parallel development. For example, once UI/UX designs for early workflows were completed (such as login), backend development could begin on related modules (such as authentication and tenant context), while frontend developers implemented the corresponding UI and view-model layers using hard-coded data or mock repositories. Once backend APIs became available, frontend integration replaced mocks with real data sources using backend-provided API contracts.

This overlapping development model improved productivity under limited team resources and reduced idle time caused by sequential dependencies.

### 2.5.2 Team Organization and Responsibilities

The project was implemented by a six-member team. For reporting clarity, members are referenced using aliases: Z, K, T, V, R, and H. Responsibilities were distributed as follows:

- **Lead Development and Documentation:** Z
- **Frontend Development:** Z and V
- **Backend Development:** R and H
- **UI/UX Design:** K and T
- **Acceptance Testing:** Z

This structure supported specialization while allowing the lead developer to coordinate integration efforts and maintain consistency across documentation and implementation.

### 2.5.3 Work Coordination and Communication

Work coordination followed a task-driven approach rather than daily meetings. Because all team members were full-time students, the project did not adopt daily stand-ups. Instead, coordination occurred through:

- Kickoff meetings at the start of assigned tasks to clarify requirements and expected outcomes.
- Evaluation meetings upon task completion to review implementation results and validate alignment with module specifications.

Meetings were typically conducted one-to-one between the lead developer (Z) and the team member responsible for the task, enabling focused technical discussion and faster decision-making.

Progress tracking was managed using a lightweight Scrum-style board during development, with the intention to transition toward a more formal tool such as Jira for improved visibility and reporting.

### 2.5.4 Planning Adaptation and Specification Refinement

A defining characteristic of the project planning process was the continuous refinement of module specifications as implementation progressed. Early planning identified functional areas such as sales, inventory, reporting, multi-branch support, and staff attendance; however, several components were initially underspecified due to limited team experience in modular system design.

During execution, the team improved planning quality by systematically refining module specifications to:

- explicitly define module boundaries and responsibilities,
- clarify dependencies and cross-module impacts,
- remove ambiguous or impractical business logic, and
- align documentation more closely with what could be implemented within Capstone I constraints.

This refinement led to important discoveries and adjustments. For example, multi-branch support was reinterpreted not as a standalone module but as part of the tenant-and-branch context. Additionally, the need for a dedicated cash session module emerged after identifying integrity risks in sales workflows.

The UI/UX development process also influenced specification refinement. While wireframes provided strong structural guidance, interaction details were often faster to validate through frontend prototypes than through exhaustive design-tool simulation. As a result, manual testing and real usage flows became an important feedback mechanism that informed iterative improvement of both the module specifications and system behavior.

Overall, the project planning approach can be characterized as **goal-driven and iterative**: a structured phase plan provided direction, while continuous refinement ensured that the system remained feasible, consistent, and aligned with real operational constraints discovered through development.
