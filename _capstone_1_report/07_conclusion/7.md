## 7.1 Completed Features

This section summarizes the features and modules implemented during Capstone I, categorized according to their level of completion within the defined project scope. The term **“implemented”** refers to functionality that is completed, demonstrable, and aligned with the Capstone I scope, rather than production-grade completeness. Several modules were intentionally implemented with functional limitations or deferred elements due to time, resource, and scope constraints.

### 7.1.1 Core Modules

**Authentication and Authorization**

Authentication and authorization were implemented using a role-based access control (RBAC) model supporting Administrators, Managers, and Cashiers. Phone-based login, session handling, and role scoping were completed. The system supports multiple tenants per account, allowing a single user to access multiple business entities. Advanced security mechanisms such as OTP-based verification and account recovery flows were designed but not implemented within Capstone I.

**Tenant Context**

The tenant module was implemented to represent a business entity within the system. Each tenant acts as a logical boundary for data isolation, policy configuration, and feature access. Tenant creation is currently handled manually by developers, as the automated billing and subscription engine that would normally provision tenants is outside the scope of Capstone I.

**Branch Management**

Branch management was implemented as a dedicated core module. Branches are provisioned by the system (rather than created manually by users) during tenant setup or when additional branches are enabled. The module supports branch metadata management (name, address, contact information) and branch freezing. Freezing a branch prevents operational actions (such as sales or attendance) while preserving historical data for reporting and auditing.

**Policy and Configuration**

The policy and configuration module was fully implemented within Capstone I. Policies govern operational behavior such as VAT application, currency conversion and rounding, inventory deduction rules, cash session enforcement, and attendance constraints. Policies are resolved in a branch-scoped context and applied consistently across dependent modules, enabling flexible yet controlled system behavior.

**Audit Logging**

Audit logging was designed as a cross-cutting core module to capture critical system actions across all modules. Branch lifecycle events (provisioning, updates, freezing) and operational denials due to frozen branches are logged. While some audit coverage was completed later in the project timeline, the module provides a consistent foundation for traceability and accountability.

**Sync and Offline Support**

Full offline synchronization was deferred. Client-side storage and queuing mechanisms were prepared, but complete offline workflows, conflict resolution, and retry strategies were not finalized within Capstone I due to complexity and limited development time.

### 7.1.2 Feature Modules

**Sales and Order Management**

Sales and order management were fully implemented and form the operational core of Modula. The module supports cart-based sales, policy-enforced checkout, multi-currency cash handling, order lifecycle management, and approval-based sale voiding. Sales are branch-scoped and tightly integrated with inventory, cash sessions, discounts, and audit logging.

**Menu Management**

Menu management was implemented with support for menu items, categories, modifiers, and branch-level assignment. The module allows administrators to configure menus per branch. Although recipe-to-inventory mappings exist, automatic inventory deduction based on recipes was deferred.

**Inventory Management**

Inventory management was implemented with support for stock items, branch-level stock tracking, restocking, expiry tracking, and inventory journaling. The module maintains accurate historical records and supports reporting. Recipe-based automatic deduction was intentionally deferred.

**Staff Management**

Staff management was implemented to support staff invitation, role assignment, and branch association. The module focuses on operational staffing rather than credential management, which remains the responsibility of the authentication module.

**Staff Attendance**

The staff attendance module was fully implemented, providing check-in and check-out functionality, shift enforcement, and approval workflows for out-of-shift attendance. Attendance is branch-scoped and integrates with policy configuration to enforce operational rules.

**Reporting**

Basic reporting was implemented to support sales, inventory, attendance, and cash session summaries. Reports preserve historical data even for frozen branches and correctly represent pending void transactions. Advanced analytics and cross-branch aggregation were deferred.

**Discount Management**

Discount management was specified and partially designed but not implemented during Capstone I. The module was deferred in favor of prioritizing core transactional stability.

**Receipt and Electronic Receipt**

Receipt and electronic receipt functionality was partially implemented. Static UI designs and interaction flows were completed, but dynamic backend-driven receipt generation was deferred.

**User Interface and User Experience**

UI and UX were developed iteratively. Detailed wireframes guided development, but final interaction behavior was refined during frontend implementation and manual testing. Feedback from implementation informed adjustments to module specifications.

**Infrastructure and Deployment**

Production infrastructure, cloud deployment, and containerization were not implemented during Capstone I. The system currently runs in a local development environment, with infrastructure planning deferred to future phases.

---

In summary, Capstone I successfully delivered the foundational core and feature modules required for a functional, modular POS system. Certain components were intentionally limited or deferred to maintain architectural clarity, transactional correctness, and feasibility within the project’s constraints.

## 7.2 Difficulties

The development of Modula POS revealed a range of challenges that reflect the realities of building a complex, modular system within the constraints of an academic capstone project.

One of the most significant difficulties was managing the interdependency of modules in a modular architecture. Although Modula was designed using modular principles, complete decoupling proved impractical. Core modules such as Authentication, Tenant and Branch Context, Policy and Configuration, Sales, Inventory, Cash Session, Attendance, and Reporting share foundational concepts such as branch context, policy resolution, and transactional integrity. As a result, changes in one module—such as redefining policies from tenant-wide to branch-scoped or introducing a dedicated Branch module—necessitated coordinated updates across multiple other modules. This ripple effect increased development complexity and required careful consistency checks throughout the system.

Another major challenge involved maintaining alignment between documentation and implementation. Modula relied heavily on module specifications (mod specs) to guide both frontend and backend development. However, as implementation progressed and manual testing revealed practical usability and business logic issues, several early assumptions in the specifications became invalid or incomplete. Updating mod specs while simultaneously refactoring code, database structures, and API contracts required continuous effort. Ensuring that documentation accurately reflected the evolving system state proved to be time-consuming but necessary to avoid divergence between design and implementation.

The project also faced integration challenges between frontend and backend development. Although both sides were developed in parallel using agreed specifications, integration frequently exposed mismatches in data payloads, naming conventions, and lifecycle expectations. Complex workflows—such as sale finalization, discount resolution, inventory deduction, cash session enforcement, void approval, and offline synchronization—required multiple iterations to stabilize across system layers.

In addition, the team encountered constraints related to limited experience and time availability. Several architectural and technical aspects of the system—including offline-first design, transactional consistency, policy-driven behavior, modular backend design, and synchronization strategies—extended beyond prior academic exposure. The learning curve associated with these topics consumed a substantial portion of the project timeline, making it difficult to progress according to the original schedule.

Overall, these difficulties highlighted the gap between conceptual system design and real-world implementation. While challenging, they provided valuable insight into the complexity of production-oriented software development, particularly in systems that must balance correctness, usability, and extensibility.

## **7.3 Lessons Learned**

The Modula POS project provided substantial learning outcomes in both technical and non-technical dimensions of software engineering.

A key lesson was the importance of realistic scope definition and incremental delivery. The initial scope of Modula was highly ambitious, aiming to implement numerous core and feature modules within a limited timeframe. In practice, the available time and human resources were insufficient to fully realize all planned components at a production-ready level. This experience reinforced the necessity of prioritizing essential functionality, clearly distinguishing between Capstone I deliverables and future work, and embracing incremental development rather than attempting comprehensive coverage from the outset.

Another important lesson concerned modularity and dependency management. While modular architecture improves clarity and maintainability, it does not eliminate dependencies between modules. The project demonstrated that shared domain concepts—such as branch context, policy enforcement, and transactional data—naturally span multiple modules. Effective modular design therefore requires ongoing coordination, explicit boundaries, and disciplined change management, rather than assuming complete isolation between components.

The team also learned the value of adaptive and evolving documentation. Early module specifications attempted to define implementation details too precisely, including assumptions about API endpoints, database tables, and frontend workflows. This approach made documentation brittle and difficult to maintain as requirements evolved. Transitioning to higher-level mod specs—focused on purpose, use cases, requirements, and acceptance criteria—proved more effective and reduced friction between documentation and development.

From a project management perspective, the team gained insight into accurately estimating team capability and learning curves. Although team members possessed foundational programming knowledge, building a real-world POS system introduced unforeseen technical challenges. Significant time was spent learning new tools, debugging integration issues, and revising architectural decisions. This emphasized the importance of accounting for skill development, experimentation, and iteration when planning complex software projects.

Despite these challenges, the project delivered meaningful outcomes. Team members developed deeper understanding of modular system design, cross-layer integration, offline-first architectures, API versioning, and collaborative workflows between frontend and backend development. The difficulties encountered ultimately strengthened technical judgment and fostered a more realistic appreciation of software engineering practice. Modula POS thus served not only as a functional capstone project, but also as a valuable simulation of real-world system development, where adaptability, communication, and iterative improvement are critical to success.

## 7.4 Perspectives

This section outlines the potential future directions of the Modula POS system beyond the scope of Capstone I. These perspectives do not represent immediate implementation commitments; rather, they identify feasible extensions enabled by the current architectural foundation, modular design, and technology choices. The discussion reflects both technical opportunities and lessons learned during development, positioning Modula for continued evolution as a scalable POS platform.

### 7.4.1 Functional Extensions

One of the primary areas for future development is the expansion of functional features that were intentionally deferred or only partially implemented in Capstone I. In particular, the **sync and offline support module** represents a significant opportunity for enhancement. While the current system design anticipates offline operation through client-side storage and queued synchronization, future work may include more advanced conflict resolution strategies, background synchronization processes, retry queues, and improved user feedback during network disruptions. These improvements would strengthen Modula’s suitability for real-world environments with unstable connectivity.

Another important extension involves **discount management**, which is designed conceptually but not fully implemented in Capstone I. Future iterations may introduce richer branch-scoped discount configurations, clearer rule visualization for administrators, and tighter integration with reporting modules. Similarly, **receipt and eReceipt customization** may be expanded beyond static layouts to support dynamic templates, enhanced branding options, and localized formatting tailored to individual branches.

Reporting functionality may also evolve toward more advanced **operational analytics**, such as historical trend analysis, comparative summaries across time periods, and key performance indicators. These enhancements would allow business owners to gain deeper insight into sales and inventory behavior while remaining focused on operational decision-making rather than complex business intelligence systems.

### 7.4.2 Architectural and Infrastructure Evolution

From an architectural perspective, Modula is intentionally designed to remain **hosting-provider agnostic**, allowing infrastructure decisions to be evaluated independently of application logic. In later phases, the system may be containerized using technologies such as Docker to support consistent deployment across development, staging, and production environments. This would simplify setup, scaling, and maintenance while preserving the modular monolithic architecture established in Capstone I.

As system usage grows, further refinements to database migration strategies, API versioning, and event-driven integration may be introduced. The existing separation between feature modules and shared platform services provides a strong foundation for scaling individual components without compromising overall system coherence. These architectural evolutions are intended to support long-term reliability and maintainability as Modula transitions from an academic prototype into a sustainable software product.

### 7.4.3 Security and Reliability Improvements

Although Modula implements core authentication and authorization mechanisms in Capstone I, several security-related enhancements are planned for future phases. These include **OTP-based verification** for sensitive account actions, stronger rate limiting to prevent abuse, and additional safeguards against denial-of-service scenarios. Such measures would enhance system resilience while aligning Modula with established security practices used in production-grade POS systems.

Reliability improvements may also involve more comprehensive audit coverage, automated database backup strategies, and enhanced monitoring of critical operations such as cash reconciliation and inventory updates. These enhancements are supported by the existing audit logging and policy-driven design, which were deliberately structured to accommodate future security extensions without requiring major architectural refactoring.

### 7.4.4 Product and Platform Growth

Modula’s long-term vision extends beyond its initial web-based deployment. The use of Flutter enables **mobile-native expansion**, allowing the development of tablet or smartphone POS applications without rewriting core frontend logic. This supports multi-device usage scenarios and aligns with modern POS deployment trends observed in commercial systems.

Future development may also explore controlled **hardware integration**, such as receipt printers, barcode scanners, or cash drawers, building upon the existing cash session and order workflows. In addition, improvements to **multi-tenant account support** may allow a single user account to manage multiple businesses more seamlessly, addressing limitations identified during Capstone I.

Overall, these perspectives demonstrate that Modula’s current implementation is not an isolated academic exercise but a deliberately structured foundation for continued development. By prioritizing modularity, clarity of responsibilities, and policy-driven behavior, the system is well-positioned to evolve incrementally while preserving consistency, maintainability, and technical integrity.
