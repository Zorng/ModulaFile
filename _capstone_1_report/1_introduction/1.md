# 1. Introduction

This section provides an overview of our capstone project, which was designed to give us hands-on experience with practical problems by encouraging us to apply theoretical knowledge, technical skills, and business logic in a real-world context. Throughout this valuable period, we had the opportunity to contribute as a team and engage deeply with the project’s objectives, gaining insights into effective project management, teamwork, and the application of software development principles. This experience has helped us understand the workflow, challenges, and solutions involved in developing a complete system, preparing us for future professional endeavors.

### 1.1  presentation of capstone

In our third year, we are required to complete a capstone project. This capstone project is an important part of our curriculum, designed to give us the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills we have gained throughout our studies in a practical and meaningful way.

The purpose of the capstone project is to solve real-world problems by developing a complete and functional system. It challenges us to integrate theories and concepts from various subjects such as software engineering, system analysis, and project management. This experience prepares us for the challenges we may face in professional environments after graduation.

Throughout the project, we are expected to conduct research, analyze requirements, design the system, implement the solution, and report on our progress and results. This process allows us to demonstrate essential skills, including project management, teamwork, technical application, problem-solving, and effective communication.

By working on the capstone project as a team, we aim to gain hands-on experience in managing a real project from start to finish and to prove our ability to collaborate and deliver a quality system that meets specific needs.

### 1.1.1  Objective of Capstone

The main objective of our capstone project is to provide a comprehensive academic experience where we apply and integrate the knowledge and skills acquired throughout our degree program. This includes concepts from various subjects such as software engineering, system analysis, database management, and project management. By combining these disciplines, we aim to demonstrate our ability to develop practical and effective solutions.

We aim to design and develop a functional system or solution that addresses a real-world problem. This process helps us improve our critical thinking and problem-solving skills by analyzing requirements, creating effective designs, and implementing reliable solutions.

Additionally, the project prepares us for real-world software development by simulating a professional environment where teamwork, communication, and time management are essential. Working as a team, we learn to coordinate tasks and combine our efforts to deliver a complete and well-documented product.

Overall, the capstone project is meant to build our confidence and readiness for future careers in software development by giving us practical experience in managing and completing a full project lifecycle.

### 1.1.2  Duration of Capstone

Our capstone project lasts for 6 months across two main phases: **Capstone I** and **Capstone II**. In this report, we focus on the activities completed during Capstone I.

We conduct the capstone project over a defined academic period, beginning on **1st October 2025** and concluding on **17th December 2025**, with a total duration of approximately 10 to 12 weeks for Capstone I. This period is structured to allow us sufficient time for planning, development, and evaluation.

The project duration is divided into several major phases, including requirement analysis, system design, development, testing, and documentation. Throughout these phases, we establish specific milestones and evaluation checkpoints to monitor our progress and ensure alignment with project objectives. This structured timeline supports effective project management and helps us successfully complete the capstone project within the allocated timeframe.
