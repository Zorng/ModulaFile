## 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements

This subsection defines the non-functional requirements of the Modula system, focusing on the quality attributes that determine how well the system performs its intended functions. Unlike functional requirements, which describe what the system does, non-functional requirements describe the conditions under which the system operates and the qualities it must exhibit to be reliable, usable, and maintainable in real-world environments.

The non-functional requirements presented here are derived from the operational context of small and medium-sized F&B businesses in Cambodia, technical constraints identified during development, and best practices observed in mature POS systems. These requirements are scoped strictly to Capstone I and reflect deliberate design trade-offs made during implementation.

### 4.2.1 Security

The system shall ensure that business data and operations are protected against unauthorized access and misuse.

- The system shall enforce role-based access control to restrict sensitive actions such as voiding sales, managing inventory, and viewing reports.
- The system shall ensure that authentication credentials are securely handled and never exposed in plaintext.
- The system shall prevent unauthorized modification of finalized transactional data, including sales, inventory records, and attendance logs.
- The system shall record critical actions in an audit log to support traceability and accountability.

These security measures are essential in POS systems to prevent fraud, data tampering, and unauthorized operational changes.

### 4.2.2 Performance

The system shall provide responsive performance suitable for high-frequency transactional environments.

- The system shall support rapid item selection and checkout workflows to minimize customer wait times.
- The system shall perform core operations such as sale creation and cart calculation with minimal latency.
- The system shall continue to function during intermittent network connectivity without blocking essential operations.

Performance considerations are particularly important in retail and F&B contexts where delays directly affect customer experience.

### 4.2.3 Usability

The system shall be designed to be intuitive and easy to use for staff with varying levels of technical familiarity.

- The system shall minimize manual decision-making during sales by automating calculations such as discounts, tax, and currency conversion.
- The system shall provide role-specific user interfaces, ensuring that users only see features relevant to their responsibilities.
- The system shall present policies and configuration options in a structured and understandable manner, similar to familiar settings interfaces.
- The system shall allow common workflows, such as sales and attendance actions, to be completed with minimal steps.

High usability reduces training time and operational errors in fast-paced service environments.

### 4.2.4 Reliability

The system shall operate consistently and preserve data integrity under normal and adverse conditions.

- The system shall ensure that transactional data remains consistent even when operations are performed offline.
- The system shall use journal-based recording for critical data such as inventory movements and cash sessions to prevent data loss.
- The system shall ensure that partial or failed operations do not result in inconsistent system states.
- The system shall preserve historical records even when entities such as menu items or staff accounts are archived.

Reliability is critical in POS systems where data loss or inconsistency can directly impact financial reporting.

---

### 4.2.5 Portability

The system shall be deployable and usable across multiple device types and environments.

- The system shall be accessible through modern web browsers on phones, tablets, and computers.
- The system shall not require dedicated POS hardware to perform core operations in Capstone I.
- The system shall support future extension to mobile applications without fundamental architectural changes.

This ensures that Modula remains accessible to small businesses with limited hardware resources.

---

### 4.2.6 Maintainability

The system shall be structured to support long-term maintenance and incremental enhancement.

- The system shall adopt a modular architecture separating core modules from feature modules.
- The system shall allow individual modules to evolve independently without requiring full system redesign.
- The system shall centralize cross-cutting concerns such as policy enforcement and audit logging.
- The system shall limit inter-module coupling to clearly defined interfaces.

Maintainability ensures that Modula can evolve beyond Capstone I without accumulating excessive technical debt.

---

### 4.2.7 Scalability

The system shall be capable of supporting growth in users, data volume, and operational complexity.

- The system shall support multiple tenants within a single deployment.
- The system shall support expansion from single-branch to multi-branch operations.
- The system shall allow new feature modules to be added without disrupting existing workflows.

Scalability considerations ensure that Modula can transition from a capstone project to a production-ready platform.

Together, these non-functional requirements define the quality standards Modula must meet to be considered a reliable, usable, and maintainable POS system within its defined scope.
