### 4.3.3 Activity Diagram

Activity diagrams are used in this project to illustrate the dynamic behavior of the Modula POS system from a user-oriented perspective. While the use case diagram presents *what* interactions are possible between users and the system, activity diagrams focus on *how* these interactions unfold over time, highlighting decision points, alternative flows, and the coordination between user actions and system responses.

Given the breadth of functionality within Modula, only **key workflows** were selected for activity modeling. The diagrams included in this section represent critical and representative processes that capture the core operational logic of the system while avoiding unnecessary duplication. Specifically, the following workflows are modeled:

- **User Login and Role-Based Navigation**, which demonstrates authentication, role resolution, and tenant selection behavior.
- **Sale and Order Creation**, which represents the primary transactional workflow of the POS system, from item selection to sale finalization.

These workflows were chosen because they:
- are central to daily system usage,
- involve multiple decision branches and policy-dependent behavior, and
- demonstrate the interaction between users and core system rules.

The activity diagrams intentionally abstract away implementation-level details such as API calls, database operations, session management, and asynchronous processing. Instead, the system is represented as a single logical actor, allowing the diagrams to remain accessible to a non-technical audience while still conveying meaningful system behavior.

Detailed implementation logic corresponding to these workflows is addressed later in the report, particularly in the Implementation chapter.
