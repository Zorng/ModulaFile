## 3.2 Foundation of POS Systems and Modular Software

### 3.2.1 Introduction to POS

A **Point of Sale (POS)** refers to the location or moment where a sale occurs, marking the transfer of goods from the retailer to the customer and accounting for applicable taxes. A **POS system** extends this concept by providing software-driven management of sales operations, offering real-time control over inventory, sales analysis, and near-real-time insights to support informed decision-making [1].

Historically, POS systems were limited to fixed cash registers and manual inventory tracking. While sufficient for simple transactions, these systems lacked flexibility and real-time data processing. Technological advancements have transformed POS solutions into **mobile and cloud-based systems**, offering greater speed, mobility, and centralized access to data. Modern POS integrates wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), cloud computing, and advanced applications such as sales tracking, inventory management, and analytics, enabling businesses to operate more efficiently [2].

In business, particularly in retail, restaurants, and cafés, POS systems streamline transactions, improve operational efficiency, and support data-driven decision-making. In the Food and Beverage (F&B) industry, they accelerate order processing, optimize food production, reduce service and payment times, and enhance overall operational control, which is crucial for meeting customer demands and managing high-volume operations effectively [3].

### 3.2.2 Core module of Modern POS system

Modern POS systems are designed to support business operations efficiently by integrating essential modules that handle sales, inventory, staff management, and reporting. These core modules include:

- **Inventory Tracking:** Monitors stock levels in real-time, provides alerts for low inventory, and helps manage restocking and supplier orders.
- **Sales & Transaction Management:** Facilitates smooth and accurate sales processing, supporting multiple payment methods such as cash, credit/debit cards, and digital wallets.
- **Employee Management:** Tracks staff attendance, schedules, and activity reports, helping managers oversee workforce efficiency.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Generates daily, weekly, and monthly sales reports, identifies top-selling products, and supports data-driven decision-making. [4, 5, 6, 7]

### 3.2.3. Discussion of POS Features and Identified Gaps

Based on the core features of modern POS systems outlined in Section 3.2.2, the reviewed international and local POS systems demonstrate varying levels of feature support and system capability.

International POS systems generally support most core features, including transaction management, inventory tracking, employee management, and advanced reporting. These systems often provide robust analytics, scalable cloud infrastructures, and mature system stability. However, their implementations frequently lack flexibility for localized business workflows and do not natively support local digital payment standards. In addition, heavy dependence on continuous internet connectivity may reduce system reliability in certain operational environments.

Local POS systems are primarily designed to address regional business needs. They commonly support localized features such as KHQR integration, dual-currency transactions, and simplified operational workflows suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises. Despite these advantages, some local systems provide limited inventory management, basic reporting functionality, and reduced scalability compared to international solutions.

The analysis indicates that no single existing POS system fully satisfies all core POS features while also providing architectural flexibility and strong localization support. These limitations highlight the need for a POS solution that integrates comprehensive core functionality with adaptability to local business requirements.

In response to these findings, the proposed **Modular POS system** is designed to support all identified core features, including sales processing, inventory management, employee management, and reporting, while adopting a modular architecture to ensure flexibility, scalability, and ease of future enhancement.

### 3.2.4. Modular Software Concept

Modular software is a design approach in which a system is built from **independent and interchangeable modules**, each responsible for a specific function. These modules communicate through clearly defined interfaces, enabling changes or extensions to be made without affecting the entire system [1][2].

The key advantages of modular software include **flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance**. Modular architecture allows features to be introduced gradually through **phased implementation**, while updates and fixes can be applied to individual modules instead of the whole system. This reduces system complexity and supports long-term adaptability to evolving requirements [1][3].

At a high level, modularity in software is commonly illustrated by business applications that separate major functionalities into distinct components. For example, systems may organize **user management, reporting, and data handling** as independent modules that can evolve separately. This example is used to illustrate modular design principles rather than describe a specific implementation [2].
