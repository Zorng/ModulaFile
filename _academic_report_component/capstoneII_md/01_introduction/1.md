# 1. Introduction

This report is the **Capstone II first draft** for Modula POS. It continues the Capstone I work and updates the project narrative based on what we learned from building a prototype and preparing a production-oriented `/v0` system.

Capstone I focused on validating the product direction through a working prototype and initial module boundaries. Capstone II focuses on strengthening the system for real operational constraints (multi-tenant SaaS, offline-first operation, synchronization, and reliable backend execution), while continuing feature delivery toward pilot readiness.

Some parts of this report are derived from the project’s Knowledge Base (KB) specifications (domain/process/module contracts). Other parts require real-world project inputs (team progress, implementation status, timeline updates, and figures). When information is not yet available, it is explicitly flagged with `TODO_CAPSTONE2(...)` instead of being assumed.

## 1.1 Presentation of Capstone

In our third year, we are required to complete a capstone project. The capstone is an academic requirement designed to help students apply theoretical knowledge and technical skills to a real-world problem by delivering a complete system with clear requirements, design, implementation, and documentation.

For Modula POS, the capstone objectives are implemented through:
- problem analysis and requirement definition,
- system design (architecture, data model, and module boundaries),
- implementation (frontend and backend),
- testing/evaluation,
- documentation and reporting.

## 1.1.1 Objective of Capstone

The main objectives of this capstone are:
- to integrate knowledge from software engineering, system analysis, databases, and project management into a coherent system,
- to design and implement a functional solution that addresses a real operational problem,
- to practice professional development workflows, including teamwork, communication, time management, and iterative refinement,
- to document the system in a way that supports implementation, verification, and future extension.

## 1.1.2 Duration of Capstone

The capstone spans approximately six months across two phases: **Capstone I** and **Capstone II**.

Capstone I was conducted from **1st October 2025** to **17th December 2025**.

Capstone II continues from the end of Capstone I through the second academic phase.

TODO_CAPSTONE2(FLAG-PM-01): confirm Capstone II start/end dates, midterm checkpoint date, and the pilot target date(s) that drive delivery sequencing.
