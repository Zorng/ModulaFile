# 2. Presentation of Project

## 2.1 General Presentation of the Project

Modula is a modular Point-of-Sale (POS) system designed to provide small and medium-sized businesses with a flexible and accessible digital solution for managing daily operations. The project was initiated during Capstone I and is continued in Capstone II with an expanded focus on real operational constraints, including multi-tenant SaaS structure, offline-first operation, and reliable synchronization.

In the current scope, Modula prioritizes a **web-based POS experience** that works equally well across **small screens (smartphones)** and **wide screens (tablets and desktops)**. This approach lowers the entry barrier for businesses by reducing the need for specialized hardware at initial adoption, while still supporting operational growth and more structured setups over time.

A central concept behind Modula is its **modular design philosophy**. Rather than delivering a monolithic system with a fixed feature set, Modula is structured around modules that can be enabled, configured, and extended as business needs evolve. This aligns with the principle of “pay only for what you use,” allowing businesses to start with essential functionality and progressively adopt additional capabilities as needed.

Although Modula is initially developed with the Food and Beverage (F&B) industry as its primary use case, it is designed as a **foundational platform rather than an industry-specific endpoint**. The system architecture emphasizes modular boundaries, policy-driven behavior, and device-agnostic access in order to remain extensible for future adaptation beyond Capstone II.

In summary, Modula is presented in this capstone project as a modular POS system tailored for small and medium-sized businesses. Capstone II continues the work by strengthening the system foundations and preparing the product for real-world operational usage.

## 2.2 Problems

Small and medium-sized businesses face a range of operational challenges when operating without an integrated POS system. These challenges affect operational efficiency, data consistency, accountability, and the ability to scale as the business grows.

Key problems include:
- **Fragmented workflows and manual processes**: sales, inventory, and staff operations are often tracked using paper or disconnected tools, increasing human error and reducing visibility.
- **Inventory mismanagement**: without systematic tracking, businesses struggle to maintain accurate inventory levels, leading to waste, shortages, and inconsistent reporting.
- **High cost of adoption**: many POS solutions require costly hardware and bundled feature plans that do not match the needs of small businesses.
- **Lack of flexibility**: businesses evolve over time (new branches, new roles, new workflows). Systems that are rigid or monolithic are difficult to adapt without high switching costs.
- **Unreliable connectivity and real-world constraints**: network reliability cannot be assumed. A POS system must be resilient to intermittent connectivity without compromising data integrity.

These problems motivate the need for a POS system that is affordable, flexible, device-agnostic, and resilient under real operational conditions. Modula is proposed as a response to these challenges through modular design and offline-first architecture.

## 2.3 Target Users

Modula is designed as an organizational POS system intended to support multiple users operating within a single business context. Users differ in responsibilities and in their relationship to the system as customers, operators, or employees. Clearly distinguishing these groups is essential to understanding Modula’s design rationale.

### 2.3.1 Business Owners (Primary Customers)

Business owners are the primary customers of Modula. They are responsible for setting up the business workspace, subscribing to capabilities, and defining how the system is deployed across their operations. Some owners operate a single location and handle daily operations themselves; others delegate responsibilities to a team.

### 2.3.2 Delegated Operators (Administrators and Managers)

Delegated operators (administrators and managers) operate within the organization on behalf of the owner. They are responsible for operational supervision, configuration tasks, and staff oversight depending on their authorization.

### 2.3.3 Frontline Staff (Cashiers and Operational Employees)

Frontline staff use Modula for routine service delivery and transactional workflows (such as processing sales and handling orders). Their access is limited to operational actions defined by the business owner and delegated operators.

### Summary

Across all user categories, Modula functions as a shared organizational platform rather than a personal application. This separation supports scalability and accountability while remaining aligned with real business practices.

## 2.4 Objectives

The development of Modula is guided by objectives that reflect both academic goals and the broader vision of creating a practical and scalable POS system.

### 2.4.1 Main Objective

The main objective is to design and develop a modular POS system that supports small and medium-sized businesses through a usable interface and a technically sound foundation that can evolve beyond the scope of an academic prototype.

### 2.4.2 Specific Objectives

Specific objectives include:

1. **Deliver a modular POS foundation**

   Define clear module boundaries and cross-module contracts so the system can evolve without becoming tightly coupled.

2. **Support multi-user organizational operation**

   Model owners, delegated operators, and frontline staff with clear authorization boundaries and traceability of actions.

3. **Support offline-first operation without compromising integrity**

   Enable resilient operation under unstable connectivity through queued actions, deterministic replay, and authoritative hydration patterns.

4. **Maintain a responsive interface across device sizes**

   Ensure core workflows remain usable on both small screens (smartphones) and wide screens (tablets/desktops).

5. **Demonstrate alignment between documentation, design, and implementation**

   Maintain consistency between requirements, specifications, architecture decisions, and implemented behavior, reflecting realistic software engineering practice.

## 2.5 Planning of the Project

The planning of Modula POS follows a phased approach across Capstone II while remaining iterative in response to discoveries during implementation. Compared to Capstone I (prototype focus), Capstone II emphasizes strengthening foundations for reliability and integration readiness (multi-tenant structure, offline-first sync, idempotency, and reliable cross-module execution patterns).

TODO_CAPSTONE2(FLAG-PM-02): summarize the key planning changes from Capstone I to Capstone II (scope cuts, reprioritization) and why they were necessary.

### 2.5.1 Planning Structure and Timeline

The project is planned using overlapping phases:
- **System and specification refinement** (architecture and KB alignment)
- **UI/UX refinement** (responsive behavior across phone/tablet/desktop)
- **Backend and frontend development** (module-by-module delivery)
- **Integration and stabilization** (end-to-end wiring and pilot readiness)

TODO_CAPSTONE2(FLAG-PM-01): insert Capstone II milestone dates (midterm checkpoint, integration window, pilot target date) and update the timeline narrative accordingly.

### 2.5.2 Team Organization and Responsibilities

The project is implemented by a six-member team. For reporting clarity, members are referenced using aliases: Z, K, T, V, R, and H.

TODO_CAPSTONE2(FLAG-PM-03): confirm whether Capstone II responsibilities remain the same as Capstone I (lead, frontend, backend, UI/UX, acceptance testing) and update if roles changed.

### 2.5.3 Work Coordination and Communication

Work coordination follows a task-driven approach. Coordination is conducted through:
- kickoff meetings to clarify expected outcomes and interfaces,
- review meetings to validate work against specifications,
- asynchronous communication for daily progress and issue resolution.

### 2.5.4 Planning Adaptation and Specification Refinement

A defining characteristic of the project planning process is continuous refinement of specifications based on implementation feedback. In Capstone II, the refinement process focuses on reducing ambiguity and improving system safety under real constraints (offline-first behavior, multi-user operations, and cross-module integrity).

Examples of refinement include:
- clarifying multi-tenant membership and invitation flows,
- aligning branch monetization semantics to paid activation,
- formalizing offline-first synchronization beyond replay (authoritative pull/hydration),
- clarifying rule overlap and lifecycle constraints in operational configurations (e.g., discount rules).

These refinements improve feasibility, consistency, and readiness for integration and pilot usage.
