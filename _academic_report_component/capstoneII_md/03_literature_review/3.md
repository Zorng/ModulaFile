# Literature Review

## 3.1 Overview of the Literature Review

The purpose of this literature review is to examine existing Point of Sale (POS) systems and related software concepts in order to support the development of the proposed modular POS system. This review first presents the fundamental concepts and core components of modern POS systems. It then reviews selected international and local POS solutions to understand current industry practices, system capabilities, and operational limitations.

By analyzing these POS implementations, this chapter identifies functional characteristics, contextual limitations, and architectural shortcomings present in existing systems. The findings provide a foundation for system design decisions and justify the adoption of a modular software architecture for the proposed POS solution.

Capstone II extension note:
Capstone I initially emphasized feature coverage and modularity. As implementation progressed, the project also encountered reliability requirements that are typical in real operational environments (intermittent connectivity, retries, and partial failures). Therefore, Capstone II extends the literature review to include reliability patterns for offline-first and distributed POS systems.

TODO_CAPSTONE2(FLAG-REF-01): add citations for offline-first synchronization, idempotency under retries, and the outbox pattern.

## 3.2 Foundation of POS Systems and Modular Software

### 3.2.1 Introduction to POS

A Point of Sale (POS) refers to the location or moment where a sale occurs, marking the transfer of goods from the retailer to the customer and accounting for applicable taxes. A POS system extends this concept by providing software-driven management of sales operations, offering real-time control over inventory, sales analysis, and near-real-time insights to support informed decision-making [1].

Historically, POS systems were limited to fixed cash registers and manual inventory tracking. While sufficient for simple transactions, these systems lacked flexibility and real-time data processing. Technological advancements have transformed POS solutions into mobile and cloud-based systems, offering greater speed, mobility, and centralized access to data. Modern POS integrates wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), cloud computing, and advanced applications such as sales tracking, inventory management, and analytics, enabling businesses to operate more efficiently [2].

In business, particularly in retail, restaurants, and cafés, POS systems streamline transactions, improve operational efficiency, and support data-driven decision-making. In the Food and Beverage (F&B) industry, they accelerate order processing, optimize food production, reduce service and payment times, and enhance overall operational control, which is crucial for meeting customer demands and managing high-volume operations effectively [3].

### 3.2.2 Core Modules of Modern POS Systems

Modern POS systems are designed to support business operations efficiently by integrating essential modules that handle sales, inventory, staff management, and reporting. These core modules include:

- Inventory tracking: monitors stock levels, provides alerts for low inventory, and supports restocking workflows.
- Sales and transaction management: supports accurate sales processing and multiple payment methods.
- Employee management: tracks staff attendance, schedules, and activity reports.
- Reporting and analytics: generates operational summaries and supports data-driven decision-making. [4, 5, 6, 7]

In addition to feature modules, modern cloud-based POS systems increasingly require reliability primitives such as offline operation support, synchronization, auditability, and retry-safe operation. These topics are addressed in the Capstone II extension section later in this chapter.

### 3.2.3 Analysis of Existing POS Systems

This section examines selected international and local POS systems to understand current POS implementations, system features, and practical limitations in real business environments.

#### 3.2.3.1 International POS Systems

##### 1. Square POS system

Square POS is a widely used point-of-sale system designed for small and medium-sized businesses, particularly in retail and café environments. Its core features include:

- Payment processing: supports multiple payment methods, including card-based, contactless, and digital payments.
- Order management and cashier interface: provides a cashier-oriented interface for placing and tracking orders.
- Sales reporting and analytics: provides dashboards with sales data, transaction history, and performance reports.
- Inventory management: includes basic inventory tracking tools.
- Staff management: includes employee onboarding, time tracking, scheduling, and staff administration. [4]

Despite its comprehensive features, Square POS has some limitations. Its all-in-one design offers limited customization, restricting flexibility for businesses with complex workflows. Additionally, as a cloud-based platform, it relies heavily on stable internet connectivity; real-time reporting and synchronization may be disrupted in environments with unreliable connectivity. [8]

##### 2. Toast POS

Toast POS is a cloud-based point-of-sale system designed for foodservice businesses of various sizes. Its core features include:

- Sales reporting and analytics: real-time dashboards and summaries accessible via mobile applications.
- Inventory management: tracks product availability and supports menu/inventory linkage.
- Offline mode: allows continued transaction processing when internet connectivity is unavailable.
- Payment processing: supports multiple payment methods, including contactless and digital payments.
- Order management and cashier interface: supports order taking, tracking, and fulfillment flows. [5, 9]

Despite its functionality, Toast POS setup can be time-consuming, and advanced features may require add-on subscriptions, increasing costs for smaller businesses. [10]

#### 3.2.3.2 Local POS Systems

##### 1. Champei POS

Champei POS is a Cambodian point-of-sale solution that can be customized for different store types. For cafés, its core features include:

- Multi-branch management: supports managing multiple outlets and aggregated sales summaries.
- Sales reporting: generates daily summaries and supports real-time access via mobile devices.
- Employee permission system: supports staff roles and duties.
- KHQR payment integration: supports QR-based payments in Cambodia.

Champei POS does not emphasize inventory management on its official website, suggesting a reduced feature scope for stock tracking.

##### 2. MPOS

MPOS is a Cambodian POS system designed for restaurants and cafés. Its core features include:

- Cashier management: supports multiple payment methods and dual-currency transactions.
- Order management: supports dine-in and takeaway orders with status tracking.
- Inventory management: supports procurement, stock tracking, and recipe-linked deduction for accurate cost control.

### 3.2.3 Discussion of POS Features and Identified Gaps

Based on the core features of modern POS systems, the reviewed international and local solutions demonstrate varying levels of feature coverage and system capability.

International POS systems generally support transaction management, inventory tracking, employee management, and advanced reporting. However, they may lack flexibility for localized workflows and may rely heavily on stable internet connectivity, which can reduce reliability in some operational environments.

Local POS systems commonly address regional business needs and localized payment standards. However, they may provide limited inventory management, basic reporting functionality, and reduced scalability compared to international solutions.

The analysis indicates that no single existing POS system fully satisfies core feature needs while also providing strong architectural flexibility and resilience under real-world constraints. These limitations motivate the need for a POS solution that integrates core operational functionality with modularity and reliability.

### 3.2.4 Modular Software Concept

Modular software is a design approach in which a system is built from independent and interchangeable modules, each responsible for a specific function. These modules communicate through clearly defined interfaces, enabling changes or extensions to be made without affecting the entire system [1][2].

The key advantages of modular software include flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance. Modular architecture allows features to be introduced gradually through phased implementation, while updates and fixes can be applied to individual modules instead of the whole system. This reduces system complexity and supports long-term adaptability to evolving requirements [1][3].

## 3.3 Reliability Patterns for Modern Cloud and Offline-First POS (Capstone II Extension)

While modular feature coverage is necessary, real operational environments introduce additional requirements that strongly influence system architecture.

In practice, a POS system is a distributed system:
- clients and servers operate on different devices and networks,
- connectivity can be intermittent,
- retries and duplicate delivery occur naturally,
- and cross-module side effects can be interrupted by partial failures.

Therefore, Capstone II extends the design basis of Modula to include reliability patterns that improve safety and correctness under these conditions.

### 3.3.1 Offline-First Synchronization (Replay + Authoritative Hydration)

An offline-first POS must support more than “offline mode.” It must support convergence between:
- the device’s local state (used for continuity of operation), and
- the server’s authoritative state (used for integrity, auditability, and cross-device correctness).

Typical patterns include:
- durable offline operation queues,
- deterministic replay using client operation identifiers,
- and authoritative pull/hydration via ordered change feeds (cursor-based), including tombstones for hard removals.

### 3.3.2 Idempotency Under Retries

Under unreliable networks, clients may retry requests and servers may receive duplicates. Without idempotency, duplicates can cause severe operational failures such as double-finalized sales, duplicated cash movements, or repeated printing.

Idempotency keys enable the system to apply a write intent exactly once and return the same result on retries, improving safety without depending on perfect connectivity.

### 3.3.3 Outbox Pattern for Reliable Side Effects

A POS write operation often triggers downstream side effects (inventory deduction, notifications, printing, reporting projections). If these effects are executed outside of a transactional boundary, partial failures can leave the system in inconsistent intermediate states.

The outbox pattern is a common approach to ensure reliability:
- business truth is written to the database,
- an outbox record is written in the same transaction,
- and a background worker processes outbox records to perform side effects reliably with retry safety and idempotency.
