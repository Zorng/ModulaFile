# Opening the Cash Drawer

## Context

A new shift is about to begin at the café.

Before the first customer is served, someone must take responsibility for the cash drawer.  
This moment marks the start of accountability: from now on, any cash that goes in or out of the drawer must be explainable.

The store may be quiet or already busy, but this step cannot be skipped.

## The Situation

A cashier or manager arrives to start work and prepares the counter.

There is physical cash already in the drawer:
- small bills
- coins
- an opening float prepared earlier

Before selling anything, the drawer must be officially “opened” in the system.

This signals:
- *who* is responsible
- *when* responsibility begins
- *how much cash* the drawer starts with

## What the Person Opening the Drawer Expects

They expect:
- a clear way to declare the starting cash amount
- confirmation that the drawer is now active
- confidence that cash sales will be tracked from this point forward

They do **not** expect:
- to remember amounts later from memory
- sales to happen before accountability starts
- yesterday’s numbers to mix with today’s work

## Constraints & Reality

- Shifts change hands
- Different people may open the drawer on different days
- Mistakes at the start affect everything that follows

Once the day begins, it becomes harder to reconstruct what “should have been there”.

Opening the drawer is a **deliberate pause** before operations begin.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- requiring the drawer to be opened before cash sales can happen
- capturing the opening cash amount explicitly
- clearly marking the beginning of a cash responsibility window

From this point on:
- all cash movements are recorded against this session
- responsibility is clear and bounded

Nothing is hidden, and nothing is assumed.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Selling items
- Adjusting cash during the day
- Closing or reconciling the drawer
- Explaining discrepancies

Those belong to other stories.

This story is only about **starting responsibility cleanly**, so everything that follows has a clear baseline.
