# Force Closing a Cash Session

## Context

Not every shift ends cleanly.

Sometimes the person who opened the cash drawer is no longer available.  
Sometimes the drawer was left open by mistake.  
Sometimes the situation has already gone wrong before anyone notices.

These are uncomfortable moments, but they are real.

## The Situation

The store needs to move on, but the cash session cannot be closed normally.

Examples include:
- the cashier has already left
- a device crashed mid-shift
- the drawer was never properly closed
- management needs to end the session to restore order

At this point, waiting for a perfect situation is not realistic.

## What the Manager or Admin Expects

They expect:
- a way to end the cash session when normal closure is not possible
- to do so deliberately, not accidentally
- to leave a clear record that something was exceptional

They do **not** expect:
- the system to pretend everything was fine
- history to be erased or rewritten
- force closing to silently “fix” problems

---

## Constraints & Reality

- Missing information cannot be reconstructed later
- Cash may not have been counted correctly
- Responsibility may already be unclear

Force closing is not about correctness.  
It is about **containment**.

The goal is to stop the problem from spreading into the next shift or day.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing authorized roles to end a cash session explicitly
- making it clear that this was an exceptional action
- preserving all recorded cash activity up to that point
- preventing further cash movements under that session

Force closing does not fix mistakes.  
It **marks them**, so they are visible and cannot be ignored.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Explaining discrepancies
- Automatically correcting errors
- Assigning blame
- Making force close easy or routine

Force closing exists because reality is imperfect.

This story is about **ending an abnormal situation safely**, so operations can continue without hiding what happened.
