# Anchor A1 — Setting Up the Business Team Quickly

## Context

A small business does not start with systems.  
It starts with people.

When a café opens its doors in the morning, the owner is not thinking about identity models, access rules, or permissions. They are thinking about whether the right people will be there to run the business.

Staff come and go. Some are full-time, some part-time, some temporary. New people may start this week, others may stop working tomorrow. The owner’s responsibility is not to manage accounts — it is to make sure the business can operate smoothly each day.

## The Situation

A new staff member is joining the team.

The owner needs this person to be ready to work as soon as they arrive. There is no time for email invitations, confirmations, or multi-step onboarding. The owner already trusts this person enough to hire them; what they need now is speed and clarity.

At the same time, the owner knows that mistakes here matter. Giving someone access to the wrong place, or leaving access open longer than necessary, can cause real problems during service.

So the situation is simple but sensitive:

> “I need to set this person up quickly, but I need to stay in control.”

## What the Owner Cares About

The owner cares about outcomes, not mechanics.

They want:
- the new staff member to be able to work when they arrive,
- to decide where this person is allowed to work,
- to know that access will be enforced consistently afterward.

They do **not** want:
- to manage passwords long-term,
- to remember rules manually,
- to fix mistakes during a busy shift.

From the owner’s point of view, this is about **preparing the team**, not managing technology.

## Reality & Constraints

Real businesses are messy:
- staff change frequently,
- work happens at specific locations,
- authority is shared between owners and managers,
- trust must be balanced with control.

The system must accept this reality. It cannot assume perfect planning, permanent staff, or stable roles.

What matters is that:
- people can be prepared ahead of time,
- boundaries are clear,
- and the system takes responsibility for enforcement.

## What This Story Establishes

This story establishes that:
- people are set up **by the business**, not by self-registration,
- preparation happens **before** work begins,
- access is intentional, not accidental,
- and the system exists to *support operations*, not slow them down.

It defines the expectation that **team setup must be fast**, **control must remain with the business**, and **the system must quietly enforce decisions once they are made**.
