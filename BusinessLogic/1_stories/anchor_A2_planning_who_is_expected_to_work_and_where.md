# Anchor A2 — Planning Who Is Expected to Work and Where

## Context

Running a business is not only about who is employed.  
It is also about **who is expected to show up**, **when**, and **at which location**.

In a café with one or more branches, daily operations depend on planning. Someone must decide ahead of time who will work each day, which branch they will work at, and during which hours. Without this plan, every day becomes reactive and fragile.

Planning work is not about control for its own sake. It exists so the business can open on time, serve customers smoothly, and avoid unnecessary stress for both staff and managers.

## The Situation

The owner or manager is preparing for upcoming days.

They look at the calendar and ask simple questions:
- Who is working tomorrow?
- At which branch?
- During which hours?

This planning usually happens before the day begins, sometimes days in advance. It may change, but there is always an **intended plan** — even if that plan is informal or written on paper.

From the business point of view, this plan represents expectation, not enforcement.

## What the Manager Cares About

The manager wants clarity.

They want to:
- assign people to specific branches,
- define when work is expected to start and end,
- avoid accidental overlaps or gaps,
- see the plan clearly before the day arrives.

They do **not** expect this plan to guarantee perfect behavior. People may be late. People may not show up. Emergencies happen.

What matters is that everyone knows what was *supposed* to happen.

## Reality & Constraints

Real-world planning is imperfect:
- schedules change,
- people swap shifts informally,
- last-minute adjustments are common,
- some businesses plan weekly, others daily.

The system must accept that plans can be updated and that plans can be wrong.

Planning does not replace trust or communication. It provides a **shared reference point**.

## What This Story Establishes

This story establishes that:
- there is a clear distinction between **planned work** and **actual work**,
- planning happens **before** work begins,
- work expectations are tied to **both time and location**,
- the plan exists even if it is later broken.

It defines the need for a concept that represents **expected work**, separate from what actually happens on the day itself.
