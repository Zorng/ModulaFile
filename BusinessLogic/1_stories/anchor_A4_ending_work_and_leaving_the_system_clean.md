# Anchor A4 — Ending Work and Leaving the System Clean

## Context

Work does not end simply because a person walks away from the counter.  
For a business, the end of work is just as important as the start.

At the end of a shift, the café needs clarity: who has stopped working, what responsibilities are closed, and whether the system is ready for the next person. If this moment is unclear, problems accumulate quietly—capacity appears full when it is not, access lingers longer than it should, and records become unreliable.

Ending work is about **closing the loop**.

## The Situation

A staff member finishes their work for the day.

They may be finishing a planned shift, covering for someone else, or leaving earlier than expected. Regardless of the reason, there is a clear moment when they are no longer working and should no longer be treated as active by the system.

From the staff’s perspective, this should feel natural: work is done, responsibility ends, and they can leave without worrying about what the system still thinks.

From the business’s perspective, this moment must be explicit and reliable.

## What the Staff Member Cares About

The staff member wants:
- to clearly end their work,
- to know they are no longer responsible for operations,
- to avoid being associated with actions that happen after they leave.

They do **not** want:
- to accidentally remain “on duty” in the system,
- to be blamed for issues after their shift,
- to perform extra administrative steps at closing time.

Ending work should feel like a clean handoff, not a technical task.

## What the Business Cares About

The business wants the system to reflect reality accurately.

It wants to know:
- that this person is no longer working,
- that capacity is freed for others if needed,
- that access is no longer active beyond this point.

The business also wants confidence that:
- records are complete,
- responsibilities are clearly bounded in time,
- and the system is ready for the next shift or the next day.

## Reality & Constraints

End-of-day situations vary:
- some shifts end exactly on time,
- others end early or late,
- closing duties may overlap,
- handovers may be informal.

The system cannot assume perfect behavior.  
It must support clean endings even when the day has been imperfect.

---

## What This Story Establishes

This story establishes that:
- ending work is a **distinct moment**, just like starting work,
- the system must explicitly recognize when work has ended,
- access, responsibility, and capacity must end together,
- leaving the system “clean” is critical for trust and accuracy.

It defines the expectation that **when work ends, the system should quietly reset itself for what comes next**.
