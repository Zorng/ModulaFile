# Updating a Branch Profile

## Context

When a new branch is created in Modula, it is usually set up quickly so the store can start operating as soon as possible.

At the beginning, the branch profile often contains **basic or provisional information** — a temporary phone number, a rough address, or a placeholder name such as “Branch 2”.

This is acceptable during the early setup phase because the priority is to start selling.

But over time, the branch becomes part of daily operations.  
Customers call the branch phone number printed on receipts.  
Delivery drivers rely on the stored address.  
Managers review reports filtered by branch identity.

Eventually, the branch information needs to reflect the **real and current branch details**, not the temporary information used during setup.

## The Situation

Months after opening a second location, the owner realizes that the branch has moved to a new building inside a nearby mall.

Receipts still show the old address.  
Staff sometimes give customers outdated contact details.  
Reports exported for accounting still reference the previous location.

Nothing is technically broken, but the branch identity stored in the system no longer matches reality.

The owner wants to update the branch profile so that all future operations reflect the correct branch information.

## What the Owner Expects

The owner expects:
- a simple way to update branch details  
- future receipts and reports to use the new information  
- confidence that past sales remain unchanged  
- the branch to remain the **same branch**, not a new one

They do **not** expect:
- historical sales to move to a new branch record  
- past receipts to be rewritten  
- reports to lose historical accuracy  

From their perspective, the branch is evolving — not being replaced.

## Constraints & Reality

- Branch details can change due to relocation, rebranding, or operational updates  
- Sales and reports are long-term historical records  
- Historical branch identity must remain stable  
- Future operations must reflect the updated information  

Updating branch information must be safe for history.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing branch profile information to be updated safely  
- applying changes to **future** receipts and reports  
- reflecting the updated **branch address and contact details on future receipts**  
- preserving historical sales exactly as they were recorded  

This ensures that operational information stays accurate while historical data remains trustworthy.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Creating or deleting branches  
- Managing staff assignments  
- Configuring attendance or location rules  

Those belong to other stories.

This story is about **keeping branch information accurate as the business evolves**, without rewriting the past.
