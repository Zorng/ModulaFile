# Updating the Business Profile

## Context

When a business first becomes a Modula customer, the system provisions a new tenant automatically.  
At that moment, the tenant is created with **basic default information** — usually the business name and contact details provided during signup.

This information represents the **business as a company**, not a specific store location.

It is the information that appears on:
- invoices and exports
- business reports
- subscription and billing records (in the future)
- the company header section of receipts

This default information is enough to get the system running quickly so the store can start operating without delay.

However, this information is rarely perfect.

After the initial setup, the owner may want to:
- correct spelling or formatting of the legal business name  
- update the official business phone number or email  
- change the business registration or headquarters address  
- align receipts and system branding with the real business identity  

In short, the tenant owner wants the system to reflect the **real, current business entity**, not the provisional information used during onboarding.

## The Situation

Some time after launch, the owner notices that exports and receipts still contain outdated or provisional business information.

The company phone number has changed.  
The business relocated its office.  
Reports exported for accounting still include the wrong contact details.

Nothing is broken, but the system no longer reflects the **current legal business identity**.

The owner wants to correct the business information so that everything generated from now on represents the business accurately.

## What the Owner Expects

The owner expects:
- a simple way to update business identity information  
- future receipts and exports to use the new details  
- confidence that past records remain unchanged  
- the change to apply consistently across the system  

They do **not** expect:
- past receipts to be rewritten  
- historical reports to change retroactively  
- the update to affect past sales or audit records  

From their perspective, the business identity should stay accurate as the company evolves, without rewriting history.

## Constraints & Reality

- Legal business information changes infrequently but inevitably  
- Reports and exports are long-term accounting records  
- Historical data must remain trustworthy  
- Future documents must reflect the current identity  

Updating the business profile is simple in intention, but it must be safe for history.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing tenant business information to be updated safely  
- applying changes to **future** receipts and exports  
- reflecting the updated business identity in the **company header section of future receipts**  
- preserving historical records exactly as they were created  

This keeps the business identity accurate without compromising historical trust.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Subscription or billing plans  
- Staff accounts or permissions  
- Branch locations or store details  

Those belong to other stories.

This story is about **keeping the business identity accurate over time**, without rewriting the past.
