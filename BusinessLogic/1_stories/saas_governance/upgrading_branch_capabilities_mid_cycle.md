# Upgrading Branch Capabilities Mid-Cycle

## Context

A business starts small and then grows.

An owner may begin with the core POS and later decide:
- “I want to track inventory now.”
- “I want to operate with staff and attendance now.”
- “I need more operator seats because more people are working at the same time.”

These decisions often happen mid-month, not neatly on renewal day.

---

## The Situation

The owner is already operating a paid branch.

During the month they decide to unlock additional capabilities for that branch.

They want the upgrade to:
- take effect immediately (because they need it now)
- keep billing simple (no multiple renewal dates)
- be fair (pay only for the remaining time until the next renewal)

---

## What the Owner Expects

They expect:
- an “upgrade now” action that works instantly
- clear pricing before confirming
- a single renewal date for the tenant
- to pay only for the remaining days in the current billing period
- the system to explain what changes operationally when something is enabled

They do **not** expect:
- to manage separate renewal dates for each module
- surprises on the next invoice

---

## Constraints & Reality

- Pricing is per-branch for modules by default.
- Upgrades can happen on any day.
- The billing anchor date is tied to when the first paid branch was activated.

---

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- showing the next renewal date (billing anchor)
- showing a “next invoice estimate” and an “upgrade cost today” for the remainder of the cycle
- charging immediately and unlocking the capability immediately after payment is confirmed
- keeping a single renewal date while still handling mid-cycle upgrades fairly

- Implementing proration math details
- Designing payment provider integrations

This story is about trust:
> “If I upgrade today, I should understand what I pay and what I get.”
