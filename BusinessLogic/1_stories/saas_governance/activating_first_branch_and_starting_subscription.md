# Activating the First Branch and Starting a Subscription

## Context

A business owner is trying Modula for the first time.

Their goal is simple:
- “I want to start using the POS for my business.”

They may not even have a physical store fully ready yet.
They just want to secure access and begin setup.

---

## The Situation

The owner creates an account and enters Modula.

At this moment:
- they have **no branches yet**
- they cannot operate the POS yet
- they need a clear “start here” path

The owner expects that paying for Modula should immediately unlock the ability to operate.

---

## What the Owner Expects

They expect:
- a clear “activate” step (not a maze of setup pages)
- to pay once and then have access arranged
- to avoid understanding internal concepts like provisioning
- a fast, reliable “scan → pay → use” flow

They do **not** expect:
- to create a branch “for free” and then be told it is unusable
- to pay and then wait without knowing whether the payment succeeded

---

## Constraints & Reality

- Modula is billed per branch, and the first branch should not exist until it is paid for.
- The owner may want to enter minimal branch details (like a name) before operating.
- Payment must be simple and locally familiar.
- Billing is USD-only for the March baseline.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by providing a first-branch activation flow:
- It clearly tells the owner they have no branches yet.
- It collects minimal branch details as an activation draft (example: branch name).
- It generates an invoice and displays a KHQR `Pay Now` QR for USD payment to Modula.
- After payment is confirmed, Modula provisions the real branch and unlocks access immediately.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Designing the full billing engine
- Defining plan pricing tables
- Building a backoffice finance tool

This story is about the first-time moment:
> “I paid — so let me start operating.”
