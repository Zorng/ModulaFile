# Viewing Billing Status and Invoices

## Context

An owner or admin needs to understand:
- what the business is currently paying for
- whether the subscription is healthy
- what will be charged next

They also need documentation:
- invoices and receipts for bookkeeping
- a clear history of what happened and when

---

## The Situation

The owner/admin wants to review the subscription state of the tenant and branches.

They want to answer quickly:
- “Is my branch active and usable?”
- “What modules are enabled for each branch?”
- “When is the next renewal date?”
- “How much will the next invoice be?”
- “Can I download the invoice as PDF?”

---

## What the Owner/Admin Expects

They expect:
- a clear status (active vs overdue vs frozen)
- a clear renewal date (one billing anchor)
- a clear estimate of the next invoice with simple line items
- the ability to download invoices as PDF
- a history of changes (what was enabled/disabled and when)

They do **not** expect:
- hidden charges
- pricing that requires a support call to understand

---

## Constraints & Reality

- Plan changes can happen mid-cycle.
- Some changes are immediate (upgrades), while others are delayed for safety (downgrades).

---

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- showing branch plan configuration (core + optional modules + add-ons)
- showing next invoice estimate and renewal date
- providing invoice history and PDF export
- making pending changes visible (example: a downgrade that will take effect later)

## What This Story Is Not About

- The full finance reconciliation workflow
- Accounting system integrations

This story is about clarity:
> “I should always know what I’m paying for and why.”
