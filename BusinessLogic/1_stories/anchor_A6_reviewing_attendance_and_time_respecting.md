# Anchor A6 — Reviewing Attendance and Time Respecting

## Context

Once the day is over, the most important work for the business begins quietly:  
**understanding what actually happened**.

Opening the café, serving customers, and closing the doors are visible moments.  
But patterns of behavior — who shows up on time, who leaves early, who is frequently absent — only emerge when work is reviewed over time.

For the business, this review is not about punishment.  
It is about fairness, reliability, and improvement.

## The Situation

After days or weeks of operation, the owner or manager wants to look back.

They want to answer simple questions:
- Did people show up when they were expected to?
- Were there consistent delays or absences?
- Did actual work match the plan most of the time?

These questions are not urgent in the moment, but they matter deeply in the long run.  
They inform staffing decisions, trust, and how responsibilities are shared.

## What the Manager Cares About

The manager wants clarity without guesswork.

They want:
- to compare what was **planned** with what actually **happened**,
- to see patterns over time, not isolated incidents,
- to rely on records rather than memory or hearsay.

They do **not** want:
- to manually reconstruct schedules,
- to argue about facts,
- to make decisions based on incomplete information.

From their point of view, time respecting is about **consistency**, not perfection.

## What the Staff Member Cares About

The staff member wants fairness.

They want:
- their punctuality and effort to be visible,
- mistakes or exceptional situations to be understood in context,
- to be judged on patterns, not single days.

They do **not** want:
- silent assumptions,
- unclear expectations,
- or records that misrepresent what actually happened.

Trust depends on shared, transparent facts.

## Reality & Constraints

Reality is never perfectly clean:
- shifts change,
- people arrive early or late,
- emergencies happen,
- informal agreements are made.

The system cannot interpret intent.  
But it can provide **reliable records** of plans and actual behavior.

Review is about learning, not enforcement.

## What This Story Establishes

This story establishes that:
- planned work and actual work must both be recorded,
- differences between them matter over time,
- review happens **after** operations, not during them,
- time respecting is evaluated through patterns, not single events.

It defines the need for a foundation that supports **fair, fact-based reflection on work behavior**, enabling better decisions without constant supervision.
