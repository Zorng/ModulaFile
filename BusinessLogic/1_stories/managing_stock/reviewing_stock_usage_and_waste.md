# Reviewing Stock Usage and Waste (Management Insight)

## Context

After a few weeks of running the store, inventory questions change.

At first, the team only needs to know:
- "Do we have enough?"
- "What ran out?"

But as patterns emerge, the owner or manager starts asking:

> "Where is our stock going?"

This is not a crisis moment.
It is the routine work of running a business responsibly.

## The Situation

The business has been recording stock changes:
- receiving deliveries
- making corrections when reality differs
- consuming ingredients through sales (when tracking is configured)

Over time, the owner wants to review:
- which stock items are being consumed fastest
- how much waste is being recorded (spoilage, damage, mistakes)
- whether waste is increasing or stable
- which branches (or periods) look unusual

This helps them answer practical questions like:
- Are we buying the right quantities?
- Are we over-producing certain items?
- Are staff making frequent mistakes on specific ingredients?
- Is something "leaking" without explanation?

## What the Owner / Manager Expects

They expect:
- a simple summary first (top consumed, top wasted, biggest changes)
- the ability to filter by time range and branch
- to see waste broken down by reason when possible
- to drill down into history when something looks wrong
- clear signals about what is known vs what is unknown

They do **not** expect:
- the system to pretend inventory is perfectly measured
- hidden corrections that make numbers "look nice"
- analytics that cannot be explained back to real recorded actions

From their perspective, insight is valuable only if it is believable.

## Constraints & Reality

- Not every item is tracked, especially early on.
- Some waste is never recorded because reality is messy.
- Consumption inferred from sales depends on how items and recipes were configured at the time.
- Cost information may be incomplete or inconsistent.

So the goal is not perfect accounting.
The goal is **visibility strong enough to guide better decisions**.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this by:
- making usage and waste visible from recorded stock changes over time
- showing patterns and highlights that point to questions worth asking
- allowing drill-down into stock history when investigation is needed
- keeping the record honest: insight comes from explicit recorded actions, not silent rewrites

This helps management improve operations without turning inventory into an unrealistic burden.

## What This Story Is Not About

- full accounting valuation methods
- tax filing and compliance reporting
- automated purchasing or supplier systems
- assigning blame or punishing staff automatically

Those may come later.

This story is about **management insight that supports day-to-day decisions**, grounded in the reality of how stock is recorded.
