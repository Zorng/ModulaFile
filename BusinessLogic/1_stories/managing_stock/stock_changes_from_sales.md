# Having Stock Automatically Updated by Sales

## Context

During service, staff are focused on customers—not inventory.

When items are sold, the store expects stock levels to reflect that activity without requiring anyone to manually update counts after every transaction.

Automatic stock updates are about **trusting the system to keep up with reality** while people do their jobs.

## The Situation

Sales happen continuously throughout the day.

As items are sold:
- ingredients are used
- packaged goods leave the shelf
- retail units are handed to customers

No one has time to stop and adjust inventory for each sale.  
That work must happen in the background.

## What the Staff and Manager Expect

They expect:
- stock levels to change as sales happen
- no extra steps after completing a sale
- inventory views to remain meaningful during the day
- confidence that sales are reflected consistently

They do **not** expect:
- to manually deduct stock for every order
- sales to leave inventory unchanged
- stock numbers to lag behind reality without explanation

From their perspective, stock following sales should feel **automatic and reliable**.

## Constraints & Reality

- Not every item affects inventory in the same way
- Some materials are tracked precisely, others are not
- Sales volume can be high during peak hours

Automatic updates must work quietly, without slowing down service or requiring attention.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- updating stock as a natural result of selling items
- applying tracking rules consistently once they are defined
- ensuring that staff do not need to think about inventory during checkout

Inventory remains aligned with operations, without adding friction.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Defining what should or should not be tracked
- Adjusting stock manually
- Handling mistakes or corrections
- Explaining how updates are calculated

Those belong to other stories or system layers.

This story is about **letting sales drive inventory naturally**, so people can focus on serving customers.
