# Creating and Managing Stock Items

## Context

Before a store can track stock, it must first decide **what exists**.

These are not products sold to customers, but the materials and goods that support selling:
- ingredients
- packaged goods
- retail units
- supplies that matter operationally

This work happens during planning and setup, not at the counter.

## The Situation

A manager wants to define the items that the store will keep track of.

Common situations include:
- adding a new ingredient from a supplier
- introducing a new retail item to sell
- correcting the name or unit of an existing stock item
- temporarily removing an item that is no longer used
- bringing an item back after it becomes relevant again

The goal is to keep the inventory list **accurate and meaningful**, not cluttered.

## What the Manager Expects

The manager expects:
- to clearly define what a stock item represents
- to choose appropriate units that match real usage
- to update or remove items without breaking records
- confidence that past activity remains trustworthy

They do **not** expect:
- historical records to disappear when an item is removed
- past stock movements to change retroactively
- the system to force all items to be tracked the same way

From their perspective, stock items are **definitions**, not live counts.

## Constraints & Reality

- Stores evolve over time
- Suppliers change
- Some items are replaced or renamed
- Not everything needs to be tracked forever

Removing an item from current use should not erase the fact that it existed.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing stock items to be created with clear meaning
- letting items be updated or retired intentionally
- preserving historical records even when items are no longer active
- keeping the inventory list focused on what still matters

This makes inventory easier to understand and maintain as the business changes.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Receiving or counting stock
- Adjusting quantities
- Handling expiry
- Automatically changing stock due to sales

Those belong to other stories.

This story is about **defining the building blocks of inventory**, so everything else has a clear foundation.
