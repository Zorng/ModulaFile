# Reviewing Restock Spending (Owner / Admin)

## Context

A café does not run on sales alone.

Even on a great day, the business must continuously buy supplies:
- milk, beans, sugar
- packaging and take-away materials
- cleaning and small operational items

Over time, the owner starts to care about a simple question:

> "How much are we spending to keep the store running?"

This is a management question, not an inventory operation.

## The Situation

Weeks or months have passed.

The owner wants to review restocking spending over time, such as:
- how much was spent this month
- whether spending is increasing or stable
- whether a branch is spending unusually high compared to its sales

This helps them reflect on sustainability:
- "Are we likely making profit, or just moving money?"
- "Do we need to adjust pricing or reduce waste?"
- "Are we buying too much of certain supplies?"

Without visibility, this becomes guesswork based on invoices scattered across the real world.

## What the Owner / Admin Expects

They expect:
- a clear monthly (or weekly) summary of restock spending
- the ability to filter by branch (or all branches) and time range
- visibility when spending cannot be calculated because cost information is missing
- drill-down into the underlying restock records when something looks unusual

They do **not** expect:
- the system to claim perfect accounting truth
- spending to be treated as "zero" when the cost was not recorded
- historical numbers to change for no reason

From their perspective, this is about **visibility and control**, not auditing perfection.

## Constraints & Reality

- Not every purchase will be recorded perfectly.
- Some restocks may be done in a hurry.
- Costs may be unknown at the moment of receiving stock and corrected later.
- Restock spending is not the full picture of profitability (other expenses exist).

The goal is a practical management signal that improves decisions.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this by:
- allowing restock records to capture cost when possible
- producing a clear spending summary for a chosen period and branch
- making missing cost data visible instead of silently guessing
- enabling drill-down so the owner can understand what drove the spending

This makes restocking spending understandable enough to inform real decisions.

## What This Story Is Not About

- full accounting valuation and COGS methods
- tax filing and compliance reporting
- automatic purchasing or supplier systems

Those may come later.

This story is about **basic restock spending visibility** that helps owners run the business responsibly.
