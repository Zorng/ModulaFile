# Checking Current Stock Levels

## Context

During daily operations, people need to know **what is available right now**.

This may happen:
- before opening the store
- while planning the day’s menu
- when deciding whether to restock
- when answering a simple question like “Do we have enough?”

Checking stock levels is not an audit.  
It is a quick way to understand the current situation.

## The Situation

A manager or staff member looks at the inventory to see what is on hand.

They want to know:
- which items are low
- which items are plentiful
- whether something is about to run out
- whether operations can continue as planned

This information supports decisions, not actions by itself.

## What the Person Checking Stock Expects

They expect:
- a clear and current view of stock levels
- information that reflects the latest known reality
- to see availability without digging through history
- confidence that the numbers are usable for today’s decisions

They do **not** expect:
- to manually calculate totals
- to interpret raw movement logs
- to wonder whether the numbers are outdated
- stock levels to change unexpectedly while they are looking

From their perspective, this view should feel **stable and trustworthy**.

## Constraints & Reality

- Stock changes throughout the day
- Sales and adjustments happen continuously
- Exact precision is not always possible

What matters is:
- knowing roughly where things stand
- being alerted when something needs attention

Stock visibility is about **awareness**, not perfection.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- presenting a clear view of current stock levels
- reflecting recent changes without requiring manual work
- separating “what is available now” from historical detail

This allows staff to make informed decisions quickly, without stopping operations.

## What This Story Is Not About

- How stock levels are calculated
- Reviewing past movements
- Explaining why a change happened
- Forecasting future needs

Those belong to other stories or system layers.

This story is about **seeing the present state of inventory**, so people can act with confidence.
