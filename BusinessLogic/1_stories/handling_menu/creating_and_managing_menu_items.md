# Creating and Managing Menu Items

## Context

Before a café can sell anything, it must decide **what exists on the menu**.

This work usually happens outside of busy hours—when a manager or owner is planning offerings, adjusting prices, or responding to changes like new suppliers or seasonal items.

The menu is the shared reference point for staff and customers alike.

## The Situation

A manager wants to add, change, or remove items from what the store sells.

Common situations include:
- adding a new drink or food item
- adjusting a price that has changed
- temporarily removing an item that is unavailable
- bringing back an item that was removed earlier

These actions shape daily operations, even though they happen quietly in the background.

## What the Manager Expects

The manager expects:
- to clearly define an item’s name and price
- to control whether an item is available for sale
- to make changes without breaking existing operations
- confidence that staff will see the correct menu

They do **not** expect:
- old sales to change because the menu was updated
- removed items to disappear from past records
- simple updates to require complex steps

From their perspective, menu management should feel **deliberate and safe**.

## Constraints & Reality

- Menus change over time
- Prices may be adjusted frequently
- Some items are temporary
- Past sales must remain trustworthy

Removing something from today’s menu should not erase the fact that it existed yesterday.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing items to be created, updated, or removed intentionally
- keeping a clear distinction between “available now” and “existed before”
- ensuring that changes affect future sales, not past ones
- making menu updates visible and consistent for staff

The system treats the menu as **evolving**, not fragile.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Organizing items into categories
- Customizing items with options or sizes
- Linking items to inventory
- Branch-specific visibility

Those belong to other stories.

This story is about **defining what can be sold**, confidently and responsibly.
