# Deciding What Inventory Is Automatically Tracked

## Context

Not everything in a café is tracked the same way.

Some items are expensive or limited and must be counted carefully.  
Others are cheap, abundant, or used inconsistently, and tracking them precisely creates more work than value.

Deciding what the system should track automatically is a **management choice**, made during planning—not during service.

## The Situation

A manager looks at the list of materials used in the store and asks:

- Which items should always be counted accurately?
- Which items are better handled with occasional checks or manual adjustments?
- Which materials are part of products but too variable to track precisely?

Examples include:
- coffee beans or bottled drinks that need accurate counts
- cups or lids that are used frequently and inconsistently
- ice or napkins that are impractical to measure per sale

The goal is to **track what matters**, without burdening staff.

## What the Manager Expects

The manager expects:
- to decide which components are automatically tracked
- to leave some materials untracked by design
- the system to behave consistently based on those decisions
- staff not to be forced into unrealistic accuracy

They do **not** expect:
- every item to be tracked just because it exists
- staff to manually correct tiny discrepancies all day
- the system to guess what should or should not matter

From their perspective, this is about **practical control**, not perfection.

## Constraints & Reality

- Some materials are used differently by different staff
- Waste and variation are unavoidable
- Over-tracking slows operations
- Under-tracking hides real problems

There is no single correct answer that fits every store.

The right choice depends on how the store actually operates.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing managers to decide which components are tracked automatically
- treating untracked materials as intentionally operational, not forgotten
- applying tracking rules consistently once defined
- keeping this decision separate from selling and pricing

This lets the system reflect reality instead of forcing artificial accuracy.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Forcing all materials to be tracked
- Detecting waste automatically
- Enforcing inventory discipline
- Adjusting stock levels during sales

Those belong to other stories and layers.

This story is about **choosing where accuracy matters**, so the system supports the business instead of fighting it.
