# Becoming a Subscriber and Getting Access

## Context

Before a business can use Modula, someone must decide to adopt it.

This person may be:
- the owner of the business
- a partner or co-founder
- an operator managing multiple stores
- someone responsible for choosing and paying for software

They are not necessarily the person who will operate the POS day to day.

## The Situation

A visitor learns about Modula and decides they want to use it.

Their expectation is simple:
- “I want to use Modula for my business.”

They do not think in terms of:
- tenants
- roles
- provisioning steps
- system setup details

They expect that once they subscribe, **access will be arranged**.

---

## What the Subscriber Expects

The subscriber expects:
- to establish a relationship with Modula
- to know whether they are allowed to use the service
- that their business environment will be set up or enabled
- clarity about whether access is active or pending

They do **not** expect:
- to manually create internal system structures
- to understand how the POS is provisioned
- to manage staff or devices immediately

From their perspective, subscribing is about **starting a relationship**, not configuring a system.

## Constraints & Reality

- Businesses vary in size and structure
- Some subscribers manage multiple businesses
- Setup may involve manual steps early on
- Payment and provisioning may not be instant at first

The system must allow for this reality without confusing operational users.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- recognizing the subscriber as the customer of the service
- separating subscription from daily operations
- enabling business environments to be provisioned explicitly
- making access status clear and deliberate

This allows Modula to grow from manual onboarding to automated provisioning without changing core behavior.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Operating the POS
- Managing staff or branches
- Handling payments or invoices
- Defining subscription plans

This story is about **starting the relationship between a business and Modula**, so everything else has a clear foundation.
