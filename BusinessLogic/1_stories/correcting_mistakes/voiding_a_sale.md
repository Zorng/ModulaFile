# Voiding a Sale When a Mistake Happens

## Context

Mistakes happen in real cafés.

A cashier may tap the wrong item, misunderstand a request, or complete a sale too quickly.  
Sometimes the customer notices immediately. Sometimes the cashier realizes it right after payment.

This moment is uncomfortable:
- the customer is waiting
- the cashier feels pressure
- the sale has already been completed

Voiding a sale is not routine work. It is an exception.

## The Situation

A completed sale turns out to be wrong.

The customer may say:
- “That’s not what I ordered.”
- “I didn’t mean to buy this.”
- “Can you cancel that?”

The cashier now needs a way to correct the situation **without pretending the sale never happened**.

---

## What the Cashier Expects

The cashier expects:
- a clear way to request that the sale be undone
- to explain what went wrong
- to avoid directly changing records they are not allowed to change

They also understand that:
- undoing a completed sale is sensitive
- someone else may need to approve it

They do **not** expect:
- to quietly delete history
- to invent workarounds
- to be blamed automatically for an honest mistake

## What the Manager Expects

From the manager’s perspective:
- voiding affects money and stock
- it should not happen casually
- but when it is justified, it must be handled cleanly

The manager expects to:
- see the request clearly
- understand why it was made
- approve or reject it deliberately

They do not expect:
- the system to reverse things automatically
- pressure to respond faster than reality allows

---

## Constraints & Reality

- The manager may not be standing next to the cashier
- The customer expects a response quickly
- Some cafés do not allow voiding after completion at all

No system can force people to be instantly available.

What matters is clarity, not speed guarantees.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- treating voiding as an exceptional request, not a normal action
- allowing the cashier to request a void without changing records directly
- requiring explicit approval before reversing anything
- making the outcome visible to everyone involved

If the void is approved:
- the original sale is undone responsibly
- the system records that the reversal happened

If it is rejected:
- the sale remains as it was
- the decision is clear and visible

Nothing is hidden. Nothing is silently rewritten.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Automatically deciding whether a void should be allowed
- Guaranteeing immediate approval
- Promising refunds in all situations
- Enforcing store policy

This story is about **correcting mistakes responsibly**, while respecting both human judgment and recorded history.
