# Reviewing Staff Changes (Who Had Access, and When)

## Context

In a real business, “who has access” is not a static fact.

Roles change.
Branch assignments change.
People are invited, accept, and later get removed (membership revoked).

When something goes wrong, owners and managers often ask:
- “Who changed this?”
- “When did this person gain access to this branch?”
- “Why was this person blocked yesterday?”

Without a clear history, the system feels unreliable and decisions feel arbitrary.

## The Situation

The owner suspects there was an access mistake or needs clarity about staff history.

Examples:
- a cashier says they were blocked unexpectedly
- someone operated in a branch they should not have
- a manager wants to confirm when a staff member’s access was revoked
- the roster looks different and the owner wants to know why

The owner needs a way to review staff-related changes without guessing.

## What the Owner Expects

The owner expects:
- a timeline of staff changes that is easy to understand
- clear “who changed what” information
- confidence that history is preserved
- enough detail to support accountability and training

They do **not** expect:
- to become a security analyst
- to read technical logs
- to rely on memory or verbal explanations

This is about operational accountability, not surveillance.

## Constraints & Reality

Small businesses move fast:
- decisions are made during service
- multiple managers might change settings
- people cover shifts and branch assignments change quickly

So the system should keep staff change history reliable and easy to consult after the fact.

## How Modula Helps

Modula helps by keeping a stable record of staff-related actions such as:
- member invited / invite accepted
- role changed
- branch access granted/revoked
- membership revoked (removed from active roster)

This gives owners and managers a clear source of truth when questions arise, without turning the product into a surveillance tool.

## What This Story Is Not About

- tracking staff location continuously
- detailed performance analytics
- dispute resolution workflows
- replacing human management judgment

This story is only about **making staff access changes traceable and explainable**.
