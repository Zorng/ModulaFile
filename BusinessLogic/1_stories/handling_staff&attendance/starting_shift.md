# Starting Work at a Branch

## Context

A workday does not truly begin when a schedule is created.  
It begins when a person arrives and starts working.

In a café, this moment is operationally critical.  
Opening late, having the wrong person at the counter, or allowing someone to operate in the wrong location can immediately affect customers, cash handling, and inventory.

This is the moment where **planning meets reality**.

## The Situation

A staff member arrives at a branch to begin their shift.

They may be early, on time, or late.  
They may have been scheduled, or they may be filling in unexpectedly.

From the staff member’s point of view, the goal is simple:
> “I’m here. I’m ready to start working.”

This moment should be quick, clear, and unambiguous.

At the same time, the business needs confidence that work is starting in the right way.

## What the Staff Member Expects

The staff member expects:
- to start work without friction  
- to know clearly that they are now “on duty”  
- to understand where they are working  
- to avoid administrative confusion at the start of a shift  

They do **not** expect:
- to wonder whether the system recognizes that they have started work  
- to fix account or scheduling issues while customers are waiting  

Starting work should feel like a natural transition from arrival to action.

## What the Business Expects

The business wants certainty.

It wants to know:
- who has started working  
- at which branch  
- at what time  

It also needs protection against common risks:
- someone starting work at the wrong branch  
- someone starting work when they are not allowed  
- too many people working at the same time  

This is not about punishment.  
It is about maintaining order during service.

## Constraints & Reality

Real operations are rarely perfect:
- staff may arrive without a planned shift  
- schedules may change at the last minute  
- someone may cover for another person  
- multiple branches may operate simultaneously  

The system cannot rely on perfect planning.  
It must handle both expected and unexpected starts of work.

## How Modula Helps

Modula treats the start of work as a **clear, explicit moment**.

When a staff member starts work, the system:
- records who began working  
- records where work began  
- records when work began  
- ensures that the start of work follows the business’s rules  

This creates a reliable record of actual work without slowing down the start of a shift.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Planning schedules in advance  
- Ending work or closing the day  
- Evaluating attendance or performance  

Those belong to other stories.

This story is about **recognizing the moment work actually begins**.
