# Revoking Staff Access Immediately

## Context

In a real café, access must sometimes be removed **right now**.

People leave unexpectedly.
Phones get lost.
Trust can change in the middle of a week.

When this happens, the owner is not thinking about long HR processes.
They are thinking about one operational need:

> “I need the system to stop accepting actions from this person immediately.”

## The Situation

A staff member should no longer be able to operate the POS.

This might happen because:
- they stopped working at the café
- their phone was stolen
- there is a conflict and access must be paused
- they were added by mistake and should not operate

The owner needs a fast way to remove operational access without deleting history or breaking records.

## What the Owner Expects

The owner expects:
- an action that is immediate
- clear confirmation that the staff member is blocked
- confidence that the next sensitive action will be denied (sale, void, cash session, attendance)
- history to remain intact (attendance records, sales traceability)

They do **not** expect:
- to “hunt down” every place access might still exist
- to rely on staff to log out voluntarily
- to permanently erase a person from history

Revoking access is about safety and control, not punishment.

## Constraints & Reality

Real operations are messy:
- the staff member might be mid-shift
- the cash drawer might still be open under their responsibility
- other staff may need to continue service immediately

So the system must:
- block new actions quickly
- preserve operational responsibility (cash session closure still matters)
- keep the situation traceable

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this by making **membership revocation** take immediate effect for operational safety:
- immediately prevents future operational actions by that person
- keeps historical records unchanged and auditable
- allows managers/owners to resolve responsibilities safely (without pretending they never existed)

This ensures the business can respond to real-world change without breaking system truth.

## What This Story Is Not About

- deleting staff history
- invitations or account signup flows
- payroll or HR paperwork
- detailed dispute resolution

This story is only about **immediate operational blocking** when the business needs it.
