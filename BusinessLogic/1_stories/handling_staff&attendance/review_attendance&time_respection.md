# Reviewing Attendance and Time Respecting

## Context

Once the café closes for the day, a quieter kind of work begins.

The rush is over.  
Customers are gone.  
The doors are locked.

Now the business needs to **look back and understand what actually happened**.

Running a café is not only about serving customers.  
It is also about building a reliable team — people who show up, respect time, and support each other.

This understanding does not come from a single day.  
It emerges slowly, from patterns over time.

## The Situation

Weeks have passed since the team started working together.

The owner or manager begins to wonder:

- Are shifts being respected consistently?
- Do planned schedules match what actually happens?
- Are there patterns of lateness, absence, or early departures?
- Are some staff consistently reliable?

These questions are not urgent in the moment.  
But over time, they become essential for trust and planning.

Without clear records, the answers rely on memory and assumptions.

And memory is often unfair.

## What the Manager Cares About

The manager wants clarity without confrontation.

They want to:
- compare **planned shifts** with **actual attendance**,
- identify patterns rather than isolated incidents,
- make decisions based on facts rather than impressions.

They do **not** want to:
- reconstruct events manually,
- rely on hearsay,
- or make judgments based on incomplete information.

From their perspective, time respecting is about **consistency**, not perfection.

## What the Staff Member Cares About

The staff member wants fairness and transparency.

They want:
- their punctuality and reliability to be visible,
- exceptional situations to be understood in context,
- to be evaluated on patterns, not single mistakes.

They do **not** want:
- silent assumptions,
- unclear expectations,
- or decisions based on guesswork.

Trust grows when everyone shares the same facts.

## Reality & Constraints

Work is not perfectly predictable.

Shifts change.  
Traffic happens.  
Emergencies occur.  
People occasionally help outside their scheduled time.

The system cannot interpret intent.  
But it can provide **accurate records of plans and actions**.

Review is not about punishment.  
It is about learning, fairness, and improving how the team works together.

## What This Story Establishes

This story establishes that:

- planned work and actual attendance must both be recorded,
- differences between plan and reality matter over time,
- review happens **after operations**, not during them,
- time respecting is evaluated through **patterns**, not single events.

It defines the need for a foundation that supports **fair, fact-based reflection on work behavior**, enabling better decisions without constant supervision.
