# Ending Work and Leaving the System Clean

## Context

Work does not end simply because a person walks away from the counter.  
For a business, the end of work is just as important as the start.

At the end of a shift, the café needs clarity: who has stopped working, what responsibilities are closed, and whether the system is ready for the next person. If this moment is unclear, problems accumulate quietly—capacity appears full when it is not, access lingers longer than it should, and records become unreliable.

Ending work is about **closing the loop**.

## The Situation

A staff member finishes their work for the day.

They may be finishing a planned shift, covering for someone else, or leaving earlier than expected. Regardless of the reason, there is a clear moment when they are no longer working and should no longer be treated as active by the system.

From the staff’s perspective, this should feel natural: work is done, responsibility ends, and they can leave without worrying about what the system still thinks.

From the business’s perspective, this moment must be explicit and reliable.

## What the Staff Member Expects

The staff member expects:
- to clearly end their work  
- to know they are no longer responsible for operations  
- to avoid being associated with actions that happen after they leave  

They do **not** expect:
- to accidentally remain “on duty” in the system  
- to be blamed for issues after their shift  
- to perform extra administrative steps at closing time  

Ending work should feel like a clean handoff, not a technical task.

## What the Business Expects

The business wants the system to reflect reality accurately.

It wants to know:
- that this person is no longer working  
- that capacity is freed for others if needed  
- that access is no longer active beyond this point  

The business also wants confidence that:
- records are complete  
- responsibilities are clearly bounded in time  
- the system is ready for the next shift or the next day

## Constraints & Reality

End-of-day situations vary:
- some shifts end exactly on time  
- others end early or late  
- closing duties may overlap  
- handovers may be informal  

The system cannot assume perfect behavior.  
It must support clean endings even when the day has been imperfect.

## How Modula Helps

Modula treats the end of work as a **clear, explicit moment**.

When a staff member ends their work, the system:
- records when work stopped  
- removes the staff member from the active workforce  
- frees capacity for other staff  
- ensures future actions are no longer associated with them  

This creates a reliable boundary between one shift and the next without adding friction at the end of the day.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Planning schedules in advance  
- Starting work at the beginning of a shift  
- Evaluating attendance or performance  

Those belong to other stories.

This story is about **recognizing the moment work ends and leaving the system ready for what comes next**.
