# Preventing Unauthorized or Excessive Work

## Context

Running a busy store requires trust — but it also requires clear boundaries.

During rush hours, people move quickly.  
Someone might step in to help at another branch.  
A staff member might arrive early or stay longer than expected.  
Sometimes, more people end up working than the business planned.

These moments are normal in real operations.  
But if boundaries are unclear, small decisions can create bigger problems:
- Too many people handling cash at once  
- Staff working in the wrong branch  
- People working without proper responsibility or accountability  

The goal is not to restrict people.  
The goal is to protect the business from confusion when things are busy.

## The Situation

A staff member is about to start working, or is already trying to access the POS.

At that moment, the system checks whether the situation makes sense:
- Are they allowed to work at this branch?
- Is the branch ready for work to begin?
- Is the number of active staff already at the allowed capacity?
- Is this person expected to work right now?

These questions must be answered instantly — before real work begins.

## What the Staff Member Needs

From the staff member’s point of view, the most important thing is clarity.

They want to:
- know immediately whether they are allowed to work,
- avoid accidentally breaking rules,
- understand why they cannot start work if something is wrong.

They do **not** want to:
- start working and discover later that it was not allowed,
- be blamed for situations they did not understand,
- feel blocked without explanation.

Being stopped early is better than being corrected later.

## What the Business Needs

From the business perspective, boundaries protect operations.

The business wants to ensure that:
- only assigned staff work at each branch,
- work begins only when the branch is ready,
- staff capacity is respected,
- responsibility is always clear.

This is not about mistrust.  
It is about keeping operations safe and predictable during busy moments.

## Real-World Reality

Real life is messy:
- A manager might ask someone to help unexpectedly.
- A staff member might arrive early to prepare.
- Someone might stay longer to finish a task.

The system cannot understand every situation.  
But it must prevent clearly invalid ones and make boundaries visible.

Managers can always make decisions.  
The system ensures those decisions happen consciously.

## What This Story Establishes

This story establishes that the system actively protects the business by ensuring that:

- Work only begins under valid conditions.
- Boundaries are enforced **before work starts**, not after problems appear.
- Staff receive clear feedback when they cannot begin working.
- The business maintains control even during busy and unpredictable moments.

The system becomes a quiet guardrail — helping everyone do the right thing without slowing them down.
