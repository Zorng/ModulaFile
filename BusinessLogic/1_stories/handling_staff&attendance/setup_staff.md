# Setting Up the Business Team Quickly

## Context

A café doesn’t start with systems.  
It starts with people.

When Modula is first used in a real store, the owner is not thinking about identity models or permission graphs. They’re thinking about whether tomorrow’s shift will run smoothly: who will be at the counter, who can open the cash drawer, who can help during rush hour.

In reality, staff changes are normal:
- a new cashier starts this week
- someone leaves suddenly
- a part-timer fills in for a few days

So the business needs a way to prepare staff accounts quickly, without turning onboarding into a multi-step process that slows down operations.

## The Situation

A new staff member is joining the café.

The owner needs them to be ready to work as soon as they arrive. There is no time for invitations, confirmations, or waiting for the staff to “set up their own account.” The owner already made the hiring decision. Now the problem is operational:

> “I want this person ready to work, but I want to stay in control.”

Because mistakes here matter:
- giving access to the wrong branch creates operational risk
- leaving access open after someone stops working creates security risk
- fixing mistakes during a busy shift is costly and stressful

## What the Owner Expects

The owner expects to:
- create a staff account quickly
- decide what the staff member is allowed to do (at least at a practical level: where they can work, what role they play)
- hand over a way for the staff to log in and start work
- trust the system to enforce those decisions consistently afterwards

They do **not** expect to:
- manage passwords repeatedly over time
- remember access rules manually
- “babysit the system” when the store is busy

From the owner’s point of view, this is about preparing the team so the café can operate—without introducing more administrative work than necessary.

## Constraints & Reality

Real stores are messy:
- staffing changes happen frequently
- branches and roles exist in the real world even if the system is new
- owners delegate tasks to managers but still need oversight
- trust must be balanced with control

The system cannot assume perfect planning or stable teams.  
It must support fast onboarding without sacrificing boundaries.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this by making staff setup:
- fast enough to match real operational needs
- controlled by the business (no self-registration by default)
- structured so that access decisions are explicit (not accidental)
- enforceable so the owner doesn’t have to manually “police” access later

Once the owner makes a decision—who the staff is and where they can work—the system takes responsibility for enforcing it quietly and consistently.

## What This Story Is Not About

- shift scheduling
- attendance check-in/out
- performance reports
- subscription billing or licensing debates

Those belong to other stories.

This story is only about one thing:
**getting a new staff member ready to work quickly, while keeping control in the hands of the business.**
