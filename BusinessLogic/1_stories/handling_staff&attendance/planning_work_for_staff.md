# Planning Who Is Expected to Work and Where

## Context

Running a business is not only about who is employed.  
It is also about **who is expected to show up**, **when**, and **at which branch**.

In a café, daily operations depend on planning ahead.  
Someone must decide who will be present tomorrow morning, who will handle the afternoon rush, and which branch each person will work at.

Without this planning, every day becomes reactive and fragile.

Planning is not about control for its own sake.  
It exists so the business can open on time, serve customers smoothly, and reduce stress for both staff and managers.

## The Situation

The manager is preparing for the coming days.

They look at the calendar and ask simple questions:
- Who is working tomorrow?
- At which branch?
- During which hours?

This planning usually happens before the day begins, sometimes days in advance.  
It may change, but there is always an **intended plan** — even if that plan previously lived on paper or in chat messages.

From the business perspective, this plan represents expectation, not enforcement.

## What the Manager Expects

The manager expects to:
- assign staff to specific branches
- define when work is expected to start and end
- avoid accidental overlaps or coverage gaps
- review the plan before the day arrives

They do **not** expect the plan to guarantee perfect behavior.

People may be late.  
People may swap shifts.  
Emergencies happen.

What matters is that everyone knows what was *supposed* to happen.

## Constraints & Reality

Real-world planning is imperfect:
- schedules change frequently
- last-minute adjustments are common
- some businesses plan weekly, others daily
- plans may be revised multiple times

Planning does not replace trust or communication.  
It provides a **shared reference point**.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this by giving the business a clear way to:
- record who is expected to work
- link that expectation to both **time and branch**
- update plans when reality changes
- keep a reliable reference of what was planned before work begins

This creates a shared understanding of expected work without trying to control everything that happens afterward.

## What This Story Is Not About

- staff checking in or out  
- enforcing attendance rules  
- evaluating performance or punctuality  

Those belong to later stories.

This story is about **defining the plan before the workday begins**.
