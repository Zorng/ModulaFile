# Understanding Which Discounts Were Applied to a Sale

## Context

After a sale is completed, questions sometimes arise.

A customer may ask why their total looks a certain way.  
A cashier may want to confirm what was applied.  
A manager may review a transaction and notice a lower-than-expected amount.

At this point, the goal is not to change anything—but to **understand what happened**.

## The Situation

Someone reviews a completed sale and wants clarity about discounts.

Typical reasons include:
- explaining the total to a customer
- verifying that a promotion was applied correctly
- reviewing unusual pricing during oversight
- answering questions after the fact

The sale is already final.  
What’s needed now is **visibility**, not action.

## What the Cashier or Manager Expects

They expect:
- to clearly see which discounts were applied
- to understand the outcome without recalculating
- confidence that what they see matches what happened at checkout
- reassurance that the record reflects the truth at the time of sale

They do **not** expect:
- discounts to change after the sale
- totals to be re-evaluated retroactively
- to guess which promotion caused the final price

From their perspective, this is about **explanation**, not correction.

## Constraints & Reality

- Multiple promotions may exist
- Discounts may overlap in time
- Staff may not remember details later
- Customers may review receipts after leaving

Memory fades quickly.  
A clear record prevents unnecessary doubt.
