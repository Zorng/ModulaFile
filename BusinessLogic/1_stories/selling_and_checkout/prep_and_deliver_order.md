# Preparing and Delivering an Order

## Context

Once a sale is completed, the customer’s focus shifts from paying to receiving what they ordered.

Behind the counter or in the kitchen, staff begin preparing items.  
This phase is less visible to the customer but just as important to the overall experience.

The sale is already done.  
Now the work is about **fulfillment**.

## The Situation

After checkout, the order needs to be prepared and delivered.

Depending on the café, this may involve:
- preparing drinks or food
- packaging items
- calling out an order number or name
- handing items directly to the customer

Multiple orders may be in progress at the same time, each at a different stage.

Staff need a clear sense of:
- what needs to be prepared
- what is ready
- what has already been handed over

---

## What the Staff Expects

Staff involved in preparation expect:
- to clearly see what items belong to each order
- to know which orders are waiting, in progress, or ready
- to mark progress without affecting payment or cash records

They do **not** expect:
- order preparation to change prices or totals
- fulfillment actions to undo or modify the sale
- confusion about whether an order still exists

From their perspective, the financial part is already settled.

## What the Customer Expects

The customer expects:
- their order to be prepared correctly
- clear signals when it is ready
- that receiving the order does not require another payment step

They do not expect:
- delays caused by payment or system issues
- to re-confirm what they already paid for

---

## Constraints & Reality

- Orders can overlap and pile up
- Staff may be working quickly under pressure
- Mistakes can happen during preparation
- Customers may be waiting nearby

Preparation needs to be simple, visible, and reversible **without touching the sale itself**.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- treating order preparation as a separate concern from payment
- allowing staff to track progress from preparation to delivery
- keeping fulfillment actions independent from money or cash handling

Once an order is delivered:
- the fulfillment work is done
- the sale remains unchanged
- the system reflects completion without rewriting history

## What This Story Is Not About

- Changing the order after payment
- Voiding or refunding the sale
- Inventory details
- Kitchen optimization or analytics

Those belong to other stories.

This story is about **turning a completed sale into a delivered experience**, smoothly and reliably.
