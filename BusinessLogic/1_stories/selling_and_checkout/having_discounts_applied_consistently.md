# Having Discounts Applied Consistently at Checkout

## Context

When a customer reaches the counter, expectations are already set.

Promotions may have been advertised, mentioned by staff, or remembered by regular customers.  
At this moment, the cashier should not need to debate pricing or interpret rules.

Consistency matters more than cleverness.

## The Situation

A customer is ready to pay and expects a discount to apply.

This may be because:
- a promotion is currently active
- the item is eligible for a discount
- the customer was told about an offer earlier

The cashier completes the order and looks at the total.

Both sides expect the same outcome every time.

## What the Cashier Expects

The cashier expects:
- discounts to apply automatically when they should
- the same order to produce the same total every time
- no need to remember promotion details
- confidence that the total shown is correct

They do **not** expect:
- to manually calculate discounts
- to argue with customers about eligibility
- to apply different outcomes for similar situations

From the cashier’s perspective, discount behavior should be **predictable and boring**.

## What the Customer Expects

The customer expects:
- the discount they were promised to appear
- no surprises at the point of payment
- fairness compared to other customers

They do not expect:
- staff to “make a judgment call”
- the same promotion to behave differently on different days
- explanations about internal rules

## Constraints & Reality

- Multiple discounts may exist at the same time
- Promotions may overlap
- Staff change frequently
- Busy hours leave no room for manual correction

If discount behavior is inconsistent, trust erodes quickly.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- applying discounts consistently once they are defined
- ensuring the same rules lead to the same outcome
- locking in the applied discounts at the moment of checkout
- removing discretion from the cashier during payment

This keeps checkout focused on service, not negotiation.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Defining discount rules
- Calculating exact discount amounts
- Prioritizing or stacking logic
- Reviewing discounts after the sale

Those belong to other stories or system layers.

This story is about **making discounts reliable at the moment that matters most**, so checkout remains smooth and trustworthy.
