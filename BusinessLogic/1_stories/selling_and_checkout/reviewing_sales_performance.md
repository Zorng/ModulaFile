# Reviewing Sales Performance (Owner / Admin)

## Context

The rush is over.

Customers are gone, staff have gone home, and the business is quiet again.
Now the owner (or an admin) wants to answer a different kind of question:

> "How did we actually do?"

This is not about serving the next customer.
It is about understanding the day (or week) well enough to run the business with confidence.

## The Situation

Time has passed since the last sale.

The owner wants to review sales outcomes to make practical decisions, such as:
- Was today a good day or a bad day?
- Did the branch hit its expected target?
- How many sales were finalized?
- How many items were sold?
- Were discounts used normally, or too often?
- Were there unusual voids or refunds?
- What was the mix of order types (dine-in vs takeaway vs delivery)?
- What were the busiest hours?
- What items sold the most?
- What categories sold the most?

If the business has multiple branches, they may also want to compare:
- Branch A vs Branch B performance
- Different staff teams under similar conditions

Without a clear summary, this review becomes guesswork and arguments.

## What the Owner / Admin Expects

They expect:
- a clear summary first (totals and key breakdowns)
- the ability to filter by time range and branch (or all branches for multi-branch tenants)
- the ability to drill down when something looks unusual
- confidence that numbers are stable and not silently changing after the fact
- visibility of exceptions (voids, refunds, heavy discounting) without hunting

They do **not** expect:
- to interpret raw logs to understand what happened
- historical totals to change because settings or policies changed later
- the system to "hide" mistakes by silently excluding them

From their perspective, reporting is about **truth and clarity**, not perfection.

## Constraints & Reality

- Mistakes happen during a busy shift.
- Voids and refunds happen, and they should be visible.
- Connectivity issues may delay syncing, so the system must be clear about what is finalized vs still pending.
- Owners do not have time to do manual reconciliation just to understand basic performance.

The system cannot prevent every problem, but it can make outcomes **understandable**.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this review by:
- presenting a reliable sales summary for a chosen branch and time window
- showing breakdowns that match how the business thinks (payment types, discounts, voids/refunds, top items)
- allowing drill-down into the underlying sales when needed
- making exceptional or provisional states visible instead of silently mutating history

This turns sales review into a calm, evidence-based routine rather than a debate.

## What This Story Is Not About

- forecasting and advanced analytics
- tax filing or accounting settlement workflows
- automated punishments based on reports

Those may be future extensions.

This story is about **giving owners and admins operational clarity** so they can run the business responsibly.
