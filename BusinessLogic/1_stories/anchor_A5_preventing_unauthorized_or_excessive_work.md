# Anchor A5 — Preventing Unauthorized or Excessive Work

## Context

In a busy business, problems rarely come from bad intentions.  
They come from unclear boundaries.

When too many people work at the same time, when someone works in the wrong place, or when access lingers longer than it should, the result is confusion. Cash handling becomes risky. Responsibility becomes unclear. Mistakes are harder to trace.

Preventing these situations is not about mistrust.  
It is about protecting the business during moments of pressure.

## The Situation

A staff member is about to start working, or is already working, when something does not quite fit the expected boundaries.

It might be that:
- the person is at a branch they are not assigned to,
- too many people are already working at the same time,
- the business has decided that work should not start yet,
- or a previously allowed situation is no longer valid.

These situations often arise during busy periods, when there is no time to debate rules or check lists.

The system must make a decision in that moment.

## What the Staff Member Cares About

The staff member wants:
- to know clearly whether they are allowed to work,
- to be stopped early rather than halfway through a task,
- to receive clear feedback when work cannot begin.

They do **not** want:
- to be blocked without explanation,
- to discover later that they should not have been working,
- to cause problems unknowingly.

From their perspective, clarity matters more than flexibility.

## What the Business Cares About

The business wants control without friction.

It wants to ensure that:
- only authorized people are working,
- work happens in the correct location,
- operational capacity is respected,
- rules are enforced consistently, not selectively.

This is not about micromanagement.  
It is about maintaining order when things are busy and attention is limited.

## Reality & Constraints

Reality creates edge cases:
- a manager asks someone to help unexpectedly,
- someone arrives early to prepare,
- a staff member stays longer than planned,
- multiple branches operate at once.

The system cannot predict every exception.  
But it must prevent clearly invalid situations and make boundaries visible.

---

## What This Story Establishes

This story establishes that:
- the system must sometimes say **no**,
- that decision must happen **before or at the moment work begins**,
- unauthorized or excessive work should be prevented, not corrected later,
- enforcement should feel protective, not punitive.

It defines the expectation that **the system actively guards the business against unsafe or unintended work conditions**, especially when humans are under pressure.
