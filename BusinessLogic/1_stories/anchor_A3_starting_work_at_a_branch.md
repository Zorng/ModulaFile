# Anchor A3 — Starting Work at a Branch

## Context

A workday does not start when a schedule is created.  
It starts when a person **actually arrives** and begins working.

For a café, this moment matters. Opening late, having the wrong person at the counter, or letting someone operate in the wrong location can immediately affect customers, cash handling, and inventory.

Starting work is the point where **planning meets reality**.

## The Situation

A staff member arrives at a branch to begin their shift.

They may be early, on time, or late. They may have been scheduled, or they may be filling in unexpectedly. What matters in that moment is simple:
- they are physically present,
- they are about to start working,
- and the business needs the system to recognize that work has begun.

From the staff’s perspective, this should be quick and unambiguous.  
From the business’s perspective, this moment must be controlled.

## What the Staff Member Cares About

The staff member wants:
- to start work without friction,
- to know clearly that they are “on duty”,
- to avoid confusion about where they are allowed to work.

They do **not** want:
- to wonder whether they are properly registered as working,
- to be blocked without explanation,
- to fix administrative issues at the counter.

Starting work should feel like a natural transition from arrival to action.

## What the Business Cares About

The business wants certainty.

It wants to know:
- who has started working,
- at which branch,
- at what time.

It also wants to prevent:
- people starting work in the wrong location,
- people starting work when they are not allowed,
- more people working at the same time than the business can support.

This is not about punishment. It is about maintaining order during service.

## Reality & Constraints

Reality is messy:
- staff may arrive without a planned shift,
- plans may change last minute,
- someone may be covering for another person,
- multiple branches may be operating at once.

The system cannot assume perfect planning.  
It must handle both expected and unexpected starts of work.

---

## What This Story Establishes

This story establishes that:
- starting work is a **distinct moment** that must be recognized explicitly,
- work always starts **at a specific branch**,
- actual work is separate from planned work,
- the system must decide, at this moment, whether work is allowed to begin.

It defines the need for a clear boundary between **being present**, **being allowed**, and **being active**.
