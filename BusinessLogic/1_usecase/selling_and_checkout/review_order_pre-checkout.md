# Building and Reviewing an Order Before Checkout

## Context

A customer is at the counter but the sale is not complete yet.

This is the moment where choices are made:
- items are added
- quantities are adjusted
- customizations are clarified
- the customer changes their mind

Nothing has been paid for.  
This is a space for conversation, confirmation, and correction.

## The Situation

As the order is being built, the cashier and customer often go back and forth:

- “Can I change this to a large?”
- “Actually, remove that item.”
- “Is there a discount for this?”
- “Let me check the total again.”

The order is still *in progress*.  
Both sides expect flexibility without consequences.

This is the last chance to get everything right **before committing**.

## What the Cashier Expects

The cashier expects:
- to freely add, remove, or change items
- to clearly see the current total as the order evolves
- to review the order with the customer before payment
- to make corrections without creating a mess

They do **not** expect:
- changes to be treated as permanent
- corrections to affect inventory or cash
- pressure to “undo” anything formally

From the cashier’s point of view, this is a **safe space**.

## What the Customer Expects

The customer expects:
- transparency about prices
- the ability to change their order
- confirmation before paying

They do not expect:
- to be charged accidentally
- to need approval for simple changes
- the system to feel rigid or unforgiving

---

## Constraints & Reality

- Orders can be complex
- Customizations are common
- Miscommunication happens easily
- The line may be moving behind them

The system must support quick adjustments without slowing the interaction.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing the order to be built gradually
- updating the total as changes are made
- keeping everything reversible until checkout
- making it easy to review the final order together

Until payment happens:
- nothing is committed
- nothing needs to be reversed later

This reduces mistakes and stress for everyone involved.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Taking payment
- Finalizing the sale
- Correcting completed transactions
- Order preparation or delivery

Those belong to other stories.

This story is about **getting the order right before it becomes real**.
