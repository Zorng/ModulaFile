# Completing a Sale at the Counter

## Context

The café is open and customers are lining up.

The cashier is standing at the counter, taking orders one after another.  
The goal is simple: serve customers quickly, accurately, and without confusion.

This moment is the core of daily operations. Everything else supports it.

## The Situation

A customer places an order and is ready to pay.

The cashier:
- confirms the items
- confirms the total
- takes payment
- completes the sale

Once this happens, the interaction should feel **finished**.  
The customer expects to receive their items and leave.  
The cashier expects to move on to the next person.

There should be no doubt about whether the sale “really went through”.

## What the Cashier Expects

The cashier expects:
- the final amount to be clear before payment
- the sale to be recorded exactly once
- confidence that the system will not change its mind later
- immediate visibility that the sale is complete

They do **not** expect:
- to recheck numbers after payment
- to wonder whether the sale was partially recorded
- to worry about background processes or syncing

From the cashier’s perspective, this action should feel **decisive**.

## What the Customer Expects

The customer expects:
- to be charged the correct amount
- to receive proof that the payment was accepted
- that the order will be prepared or delivered as agreed

They do not care how the system works internally.  
They care that the transaction feels trustworthy.

## Constraints & Reality

- The café may be busy
- The cashier may be under time pressure
- Hardware (printer, drawer) may sometimes fail
- Internet connectivity may be unstable

Despite this, the cashier still needs to serve customers without hesitation.

A completed sale must not feel fragile.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- treating the act of completing a sale as a clear point of commitment
- ensuring the sale is recorded reliably before anything else depends on it
- allowing the cashier to immediately see that the sale is complete
- keeping the result stable, even if something else happens afterward

If printing or syncing fails, the sale itself is still safe.

The cashier can trust the system and continue working.
