# Allowing Customers to Customize Items

## Context

Many items are not sold “as-is”.

Customers often want choices:
- a different size
- less sugar
- an extra topping
- no ice

These choices are part of how the product is experienced, but they need to be **defined ahead of time**, not improvised during checkout.

Customization is a planning activity that shapes how staff take orders.

## The Situation

A manager wants to decide how customers can customize certain items.

Examples include:
- offering small / medium / large sizes
- allowing add-ons like toppings or extras
- letting customers choose from predefined options
- preventing combinations that don’t make sense

The goal is to give flexibility **without creating confusion**.

## What the Manager Expects

The manager expects:
- to define which items can be customized
- to decide what choices are available
- to control how those choices affect the item
- to keep customization consistent for staff

They do **not** expect:
- staff to remember rules manually
- customers to ask for options that don’t exist
- customization to turn into free-form text or guesswork

From their perspective, customization should feel **guided and intentional**.

## Constraints & Reality

- Too many options slow down ordering
- Too few options frustrate customers
- Staff must be able to apply choices quickly
- Customizations should not require explanation every time

Customization needs boundaries to remain useful.
