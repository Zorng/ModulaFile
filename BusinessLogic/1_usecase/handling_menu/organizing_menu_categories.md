# Organizing Items into Categories

## Context

As the menu grows, simply listing items is no longer enough.

Managers need a way to group items so that staff can find them quickly and customers can understand what the store offers. Categories shape how the menu is read and navigated, both on the screen and in people’s minds.

This work happens during planning, not during checkout.

## The Situation

A manager looks at the menu and realizes that items need structure.

Common reasons include:
- the menu has become long and hard to scan
- new items don’t clearly fit where they are
- staff take too long to find certain items
- the menu needs to match how customers think (“Coffee”, “Pastries”, “Drinks”)

The goal is not to change what is sold, but **how it is organized**.

## What the Manager Expects

The manager expects:
- to create categories that make sense for their store
- to move items between categories easily
- to rename or adjust categories over time
- to hide or remove categories that are no longer useful

They do **not** expect:
- reorganizing categories to affect prices or past sales
- items to disappear unexpectedly
- staff to see inconsistent menu layouts

From their perspective, categories are about **clarity and flow**, not rules.

## Constraints & Reality

- Different stores organize menus differently
- Categories evolve as the menu changes
- There is no “perfect” structure that lasts forever

What matters is flexibility without confusion.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing items to be grouped under clear, named categories
- letting categories change without altering the items themselves
- ensuring that reorganization affects future use, not historical records
- keeping the menu layout consistent for staff once changes are made

Categories help people move faster, not think harder.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Creating or pricing items
- Customizing items with options
- Deciding which branch can sell what
- Inventory or stock behavior

Those belong to other stories.

This story is about **making the menu easier to understand and use**, for both staff and customers.
