# Defining How an Item Is Made

## Context

Behind every menu item is a real-world process.

A drink uses ingredients.  
A pastry uses packaging.  
A bottled product comes as a single unit.

Before anything can be sold consistently, the store needs a shared understanding of **what goes into each item**.

This understanding is defined during planning, not during checkout.

## The Situation

A manager wants to describe how an item is made.

Examples include:
- what ingredients are used for a drink
- what packaging is required to serve it
- whether an item represents a single retail unit
- how optional choices change what is used

The goal is not to measure everything perfectly, but to **describe reality clearly**.

## What the Manager Expects

The manager expects:
- to list what components are involved in making an item
- to describe how those components relate to the item
- to keep this description understandable by staff
- to adjust it over time as recipes or products change

They do **not** expect:
- to calculate exact costs at this stage
- to worry about when deductions happen
- to be forced into overly precise measurements
- this definition to affect past sales

From their perspective, this is about **clarity**, not accounting.

## Constraints & Reality

- Some items are made precisely
- Some items are made approximately
- Some materials are cheap and abundant
- Some materials are critical and limited

Different items require different levels of detail.

Trying to model everything with the same precision does not reflect reality.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing each item to have a clear description of what it consists of
- supporting both simple items and composed items
- letting optional choices influence what is included
- keeping this definition separate from selling and payment

This creates a shared reference point for how items are prepared, without forcing false precision.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Automatically deducting stock
- Tracking every small consumable
- Calculating costs or margins
- Enforcing preparation steps

Those belong to other stories.

This story is about **describing how an item comes into existence**, so the system reflects how the store actually operates.
