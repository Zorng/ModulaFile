# Controlling Which Branch Can Sell What

## Context

Not every branch operates the same way.

Some locations have different equipment, staff skills, suppliers, or demand.  
An item that works well in one branch may not be ready—or even possible—to sell in another.

Deciding what each branch can sell is part of planning, not a decision made at the counter.

## The Situation

A manager or owner needs to control menu availability by branch.

Common situations include:
- a new item being tested at one location first
- a branch running out of a key ingredient
- a store without the equipment needed for certain items
- temporarily disabling items during maintenance or staff shortages

The item itself still exists—but **where it can be sold must be controlled**.

## What the Manager Expects

The manager expects:
- to choose which branches can sell a given item
- to enable or disable items per branch without deleting them
- confidence that staff will only see items they are allowed to sell
- changes to take effect for future orders, not past ones

They do **not** expect:
- staff to remember branch-specific rules manually
- items to appear on the menu when they shouldn’t
- past sales to be affected by availability changes

From their perspective, branch control is about **operational readiness**, not product definition.

## Constraints & Reality

- Branch conditions change over time
- Availability decisions may be temporary
- Different branches may be managed by different people

The system must support flexibility without creating confusion at checkout.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing menu items to be enabled or disabled per branch
- ensuring staff only see items that are valid for their location
- keeping availability decisions separate from item definition
- making it clear that changes affect future sales only

This helps prevent mistakes and awkward conversations with customers.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Creating or editing menu items
- Organizing categories
- Customizing items
- Inventory deduction or stock levels

Those belong to other stories.

This story is about **matching the menu to each branch’s reality**, so staff can sell with confidence.
