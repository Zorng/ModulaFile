# Creating and Managing Discount Rules

## Context

Discounts are promises the store makes to customers.

They may be short-lived promotions, ongoing benefits, or special offers for certain situations.  
Once announced or used, they shape customer expectations and staff behavior.

Because of this, discounts must be **defined deliberately**, not improvised at the counter.

## The Situation

A manager wants to introduce or change a promotion.

Common situations include:
- running a limited-time offer
- adjusting an existing promotion
- pausing a discount that is no longer appropriate
- removing a promotion after it ends

These decisions usually happen outside busy hours, as part of planning and review.

## What the Manager Expects

The manager expects:
- to clearly define what the discount represents
- to control when a discount is active or inactive
- to make changes without affecting past sales
- confidence that staff will apply discounts consistently

They do **not** expect:
- discounts to change totals retroactively
- staff to interpret rules differently
- old promotions to silently disappear from history

From their perspective, discount rules are **commitments**, not experiments.

## Constraints & Reality

- Promotions change over time
- Some discounts are temporary
- Some need to be paused or replaced
- Past transactions must remain trustworthy

A discount that ends today should not rewrite what happened yesterday.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing discount rules to be created and updated intentionally
- letting discounts be activated or deactivated without deletion
- ensuring that changes affect future sales only
- keeping a clear record of what promotions exist

This helps managers plan promotions with confidence, without surprising staff or customers.

- Calculating discount amounts
- Applying discounts during checkout
- Stacking or prioritizing multiple discounts
- Explaining discounts on receipts

Those belong to other stories.

This story is about **defining promotions responsibly**, so discounts behave predictably when they are used.
