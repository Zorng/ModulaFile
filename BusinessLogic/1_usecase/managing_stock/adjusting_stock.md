# Adjusting Stock When Reality Differs

## Context

Inventory is an attempt to reflect reality — but reality is imperfect.

Items are dropped, wasted, miscounted, or used in ways that don’t match expectations.  
Over time, what is physically on the shelf may differ from what the system shows.

Adjusting stock is how the store acknowledges that difference honestly.

## The Situation

Someone checks the shelf or storage area and notices a mismatch.

Examples include:
- fewer items than expected because of waste or spillage
- more items than expected due to an earlier miscount
- damaged goods that cannot be sold
- small discrepancies discovered during a routine check

At this moment, the goal is not to explain the past — it is to **bring the system back in line with reality**.

## What the Person Adjusting Stock Expects

They expect:
- a clear way to correct the recorded amount
- to indicate *why* the adjustment is being made
- confidence that the correction takes effect immediately
- the system to remember that an adjustment happened

They do **not** expect:
- to rewrite history
- to hide mistakes
- to be blocked because the reason is not “perfect”

From their perspective, adjustment is an act of responsibility, not failure.

## Constraints & Reality

- Counts are rarely perfect
- Waste is unavoidable
- Staff rotate and habits differ
- Small discrepancies are normal

Waiting until the end of the month to “fix everything” only makes problems harder to understand.

Adjustments are most useful when they are **timely and explicit**.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing stock to be corrected deliberately
- capturing the fact that a correction was made
- letting reasons be recorded alongside the change
- ensuring future operations use the corrected reality

After an adjustment:
- the current view reflects what is actually available
- past activity remains visible as past activity
- the system moves forward from a known point

## What This Story Is Not About

- Receiving new stock
- Automatically changing stock due to sales
- Investigating long-term trends
- Assigning blame for discrepancies

Those belong to other stories or later review.

This story is about **acknowledging reality as it is**, so the system stays useful and trustworthy.
