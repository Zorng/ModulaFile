# Reviewing Stock History and Movements

## Context

When something feels “off” in inventory, people naturally ask:
- *What happened?*
- *When did it change?*
- *Was this expected or a mistake?*

Answering these questions requires looking **back in time**, not just at the current stock level.

Reviewing stock history is not a daily task, but it is essential for trust.

## The Situation

A manager notices something unusual:
- stock ran out earlier than expected
- numbers don’t match a recent count
- waste seems higher than normal
- a correction was made and needs explanation

To understand this, they need to see **how stock changed over time**, not just the final number.

---

## What the Manager Expects

They expect:
- to see a clear sequence of stock changes
- to understand *what kind* of change occurred (received, adjusted, consumed, restored)
- to know *when* changes happened
- confidence that the history reflects what was recorded at the time

They do **not** expect:
- history to be rewritten
- past changes to disappear
- numbers to “jump” without explanation

From their perspective, history should feel **honest and complete**.

## Constraints & Reality

- Not every discrepancy has a single cause
- Multiple small actions can add up
- Human memory is unreliable over time

Trying to reconstruct the past from memory alone is rarely accurate.

A recorded history provides a shared reference point.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- keeping a record of stock changes as they were recorded
- allowing people to review past movements without altering them
- making it possible to understand how the current state was reached

This turns inventory review into **investigation**, not guesswork.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Calculating current stock levels
- Correcting discrepancies
- Enforcing accountability
- Long-term analytics or forecasting

Those belong to other stories or later review.

This story is about **understanding what happened**, so decisions can be made with context instead of assumptions.
