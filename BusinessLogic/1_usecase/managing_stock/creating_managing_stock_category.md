# Organizing Stock Items into Categories

## Context

As the list of stock items grows, it becomes harder to scan and understand at a glance.

Ingredients, packaged goods, and supplies all serve different purposes, and mixing them together in one long list makes inventory work slower and more error-prone.

Organizing stock items into categories is a planning activity that helps people **think clearly about what they are managing**.

## The Situation

A manager looks at the inventory list and realizes it needs structure.

Common reasons include:
- too many items to scroll through
- similar items mixed together
- difficulty finding what needs attention
- wanting inventory views that match how the store thinks (“Ingredients”, “Packaging”, “Retail Items”)

The goal is not to change stock levels, but to **make inventory easier to work with**.

## What the Manager Expects

The manager expects:
- to create categories that reflect how the store operates
- to move stock items between categories easily
- to rename or reorganize categories over time
- confidence that categorization helps, not restricts

They do **not** expect:
- categories to affect quantities or history
- reorganizing to change past records
- staff to relearn the system every time categories change

From their perspective, categories are about **clarity and navigation**, not rules.

## Constraints & Reality

- Different stores organize inventory differently
- Categories evolve as operations change
- There is no “correct” universal structure

What matters is that the structure makes sense **to the people using it**.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing stock items to be grouped under clear categories
- letting categories change without altering the items themselves
- ensuring reorganization affects views, not recorded history
- keeping inventory lists readable and manageable

Categories help people move faster and make fewer mistakes.
