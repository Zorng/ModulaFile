# Receiving New Stock into the Store

## Context

Stock does not appear magically.

At some point, a delivery arrives at the store:
- boxes are unloaded
- items are checked
- quantities are confirmed as best as possible

This moment marks the transition from *expectation* to *reality*.

Receiving stock is an operational task that anchors inventory to the physical world.

## The Situation

A delivery arrives from a supplier.

The manager or staff member receiving it needs to:
- acknowledge that stock has arrived
- record what was received
- do so in a way that reflects what is physically present, not just what was ordered

This may happen:
- during a quiet period
- in a hurry between customers
- with imperfect information

The goal is to **bring stock into the system deliberately**, not assume it is there.

## What the Person Receiving Stock Expects

They expect:
- a clear way to record incoming stock
- to associate received items with what actually arrived
- the ability to record quantities even if they are approximate
- confidence that stock levels reflect this delivery going forward

They do **not** expect:
- the system to assume delivery happened automatically
- to retroactively change stock without their action
- perfect accuracy when reality is imperfect

From their perspective, receiving stock is about **acknowledgment**, not precision accounting.

## Constraints & Reality

- Deliveries may be incomplete
- Items may be damaged or missing
- Quantities may differ from invoices
- Staff may not have time to count everything exactly

What matters is that:
- stock presence is recorded intentionally
- discrepancies can be dealt with later if needed

Receiving stock is often the **best available snapshot**, not a final truth.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing stock to be recorded when it physically arrives
- treating each receipt as a deliberate event
- keeping a clear record of what was added and when
- letting future adjustments build on this recorded reality

Once stock is received:
- it is visible to the system
- it can be used operationally
- it becomes part of the ongoing inventory story

## What This Story Is Not About

- Correcting mistakes after receiving
- Tracking expiry or batch details precisely
- Adjusting stock due to sales
- Investigating discrepancies

Those belong to other stories.

This story is about **bringing physical stock into the system honestly**, so inventory reflects what is actually in the store.
