# Force-Correcting Stock After Serious Issues

## Context

Most inventory differences can be handled through normal adjustments.

But occasionally, something goes very wrong.

A long outage, a major mistake, a missing record, or a breakdown in procedure can leave inventory so far from reality that small corrections no longer make sense.

This is when normal adjustment is no longer enough.

## The Situation

A manager realizes that inventory records are fundamentally unreliable.

Examples include:
- stock movements were not recorded for an extended period
- a device failure caused missing or duplicated entries
- procedures were not followed during a busy or chaotic time
- the system was used incorrectly before problems were noticed

At this point, continuing with small adjustments only hides the problem.

The priority becomes **restoring a known baseline**.

## What the Manager Expects

The manager expects:
- a deliberate way to reset inventory to a known, trusted state
- the ability to do this consciously, not accidentally
- a clear record that this was an exceptional action
- confidence that operations can move forward cleanly afterward

They do **not** expect:
- past mistakes to be erased silently
- the system to pretend nothing happened
- force correction to be a routine tool

From their perspective, this action is about **containment**, not convenience.

## Constraints & Reality

- Not all problems can be reconstructed
- Perfect accuracy is sometimes impossible
- Continuing with bad data is worse than acknowledging a reset

Force correction accepts that:
- something went wrong
- history may be incomplete
- moving forward cleanly is more important than pretending otherwise

This is a rare, serious decision.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing authorized users to correct inventory decisively
- making it explicit that this action is exceptional
- preserving visibility into what was corrected
- ensuring future operations build from the corrected reality

After force correction:
- inventory reflects what is physically known
- operations can continue without compounding errors
- the system regains trust as a working reference

## What This Story Is Not About

- Normal stock adjustments
- Explaining how problems occurred
- Preventing all future mistakes
- Automated recovery or prediction

Those belong to other stories or operational practices.

This story is about **recovering from serious breakdowns honestly**, so the system remains usable instead of quietly wrong.
