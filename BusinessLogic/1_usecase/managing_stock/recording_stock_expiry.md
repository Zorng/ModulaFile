# Recording Expiry Information When Relevant

## Context

Not all stock behaves the same way over time.

Some items expire and must be used before a certain date.  
Others do not expire in any meaningful way, or their expiry is not operationally important.

Recording expiry information is something that matters **sometimes**, not always.

## The Situation

A delivery arrives, or stock is being reviewed, and certain items have an expiry date.

Examples include:
- milk or dairy products
- ingredients with a short shelf life
- packaged goods with a printed expiration date

The person handling stock needs to decide:
- whether expiry information is relevant for this item
- and if so, what expiry date should be recorded

This decision depends on how the store actually operates.

## What the Person Handling Stock Expects

They expect:
- to record expiry information when it matters
- to skip expiry details when they don’t
- the system to treat expiry as additional context, not a mandatory burden
- clarity that expiry information helps future decisions, not past corrections

They do **not** expect:
- every stock item to require an expiry date
- the system to block stock receiving because expiry is unknown
- expiry information to rewrite history

From their perspective, expiry is **informational**, not absolute.

## Constraints & Reality

- Some items are used quickly and never reach expiry
- Some items expire unpredictably
- Expiry dates may be unclear or missing
- Staff may not always have time to record exact dates

Trying to force expiry tracking everywhere creates friction without value.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- allowing expiry information to be recorded when it is relevant
- treating expiry as metadata that can guide future use
- keeping expiry separate from stock quantity itself
- ensuring expiry details do not block normal operations

This lets stores benefit from expiry awareness without being constrained by it.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Automatically enforcing expiry rules
- Deducting stock based on expiry
- Predicting waste or spoilage
- Blocking sales of expired items

Those belong to other stories or policy decisions.

This story is about **adding time-awareness to stock when it actually matters**, without forcing unnecessary complexity.
