# Handling Cash During the Shift

## Context

The café is open and customers are being served.

Once the cash drawer has been opened, the shift moves into its most common state:  
**handling money while work is happening**.

Sales are made, customers come and go, and small interruptions occur throughout the day.  
Cash handling must remain disciplined, even when the store is busy.

## The Situation

During the shift, cash flows in and out of the drawer for many reasons:

- customers pay with cash
- small amounts are taken out for expenses
- cash is added to make change
- mistakes need to be corrected
- someone wants to check how much cash should be there so far

These actions are normal, frequent, and sometimes rushed.

What matters is that each one is **intentional and visible**, not improvised or forgotten.

## What the Cashier or Manager Expects

They expect:
- cash sales to be counted automatically
- non-sale cash movements to be recorded deliberately
- a way to explain *why* cash changed, not just *that* it changed
- the ability to check the current expected cash amount during the day

They do **not** expect:
- to remember cash movements mentally
- to “fix everything at the end”
- the system to silently change numbers without explanation

## Constraints & Reality

- Shifts can be busy and stressful
- Small cash adjustments are sometimes necessary
- Humans make mistakes
- Not every correction should be done casually

Mid-shift visibility is important:
- too little visibility leads to surprises later
- too much friction slows down service

The balance is discipline without disruption.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- automatically recording cash from completed sales
- requiring intentional actions for non-sale cash movements
- keeping a running expectation of how much cash should be in the drawer
- allowing a mid-shift check of the current cash state without closing the drawer

This means:
- every cash change has a reason
- nothing relies on memory
- discrepancies are easier to understand later

Cash handling becomes a **continuous, visible process**, not a mystery solved at closing time.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Starting the shift
- Ending the shift
- Final reconciliation
- Punishing mistakes
- Long-term reporting

Those belong to other stories.

This story is about **staying in control of cash while work is actively happening**.
