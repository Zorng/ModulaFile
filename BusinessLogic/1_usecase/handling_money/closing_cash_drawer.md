# Closing the Cash Drawer

## Context

The shift is coming to an end.

The rush has passed, the counter is quieter, and responsibility for the cash drawer is about to end.  
This is the moment where everything that happened during the day is brought together and acknowledged.

Closing the drawer is not about speed.  
It is about accountability.

## The Situation

Before leaving the counter, the person responsible for the drawer needs to close it properly.

They:
- count the physical cash
- compare it with what the system expects
- confirm the end of their responsibility

This step marks a clear boundary:
- after this point, no more cash movements should occur for this session
- the drawer’s history is considered complete

---

## What the Person Closing the Drawer Expects

They expect:
- to see clearly how much cash should be in the drawer
- to enter the amount they actually counted
- to understand whether there is a difference
- to close the drawer once, with confidence

They do **not** expect:
- numbers to change after closing
- past actions to be silently adjusted
- today’s responsibility to leak into the next shift

---

## Constraints & Reality

- Small differences are common
- Counting cash is a human task
- Not every discrepancy has an obvious explanation

The goal is not to pretend mistakes didn’t happen.  
The goal is to **record them honestly**.

Once the drawer is closed, reopening the past should be difficult and deliberate.

## How Modula Helps

Modula supports this situation by:
- presenting an expected cash amount based on recorded activity
- allowing the counted amount to be entered explicitly
- showing any difference clearly, without hiding it
- treating drawer closure as a final, recorded act

After closing:
- the cash session is considered complete
- responsibility is clearly ended
- the record stands as-is

This creates trust in the process, even when the numbers are not perfect.

## What This Story Is Not About

- Explaining why a discrepancy happened
- Fixing earlier mistakes
- Reviewing trends across days or weeks
- Auditing staff behavior

Those belong to other stories or later review.

This story is about **ending responsibility cleanly and transparently**, so the next shift can begin with a clear slate.
